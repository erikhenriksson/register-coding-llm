The problem begins with a lack of awareness about disabilities and disability issues. One factor that was brought up repeatedly was the negative impact of highly visible disabilities. Some participants noted that people often have a fear of being around persons with highly visible disabilities. \"People just don?t want to look at us. They don?t want us around as reminders that this could be them at some point in the future.\" As well, some highly visible disabilities can mask the true potential and capabilities of persons with disabilities. As a result, negative judgements are placed upon individuals because their speech or appearance is not \"normal.\" \"People think I?m drunk because of the way my eyes look.\" \"People look at my disability and they hear my speech. I can?t leave those things in the waiting room when I go for an interview. Whenever I have actually got a job, I always had positive feedback. But they were all short-term jobs. Attitude is my biggest barrier.\" Women with learning disabilities commented that they were typically treated like children and not given credit when they had performed well on the job because attitudes in their workplace were such that no one believed that they could have actually done the job on their own. \"When people asked: ?Did you do that? Who helped you?? It really hurt. You wonder if you should tell anyone that you have a learning disability. If they know, they might be able to give you the supports on the job. But if you do tell them, they never take your abilities seriously again.\" Women with developmental disabilities face enormous attitudinal barriers. They also feel that they are \"treated lik"}

One year I got so excited about this that I even taught myself WML - a mark-up language somewhere between HTML and 1960s computer punch-cards. I thought I was going to be the most employable developer in town. I worked for the BBC at the time , but on my Sony Ericsson T-610 it took ages to navigate through the real mobile site to the sections I knew I wanted to read. I wrote a script that took RSS feeds from some BBC Sport sections I was interested in, and then published the headlines and links out as a WML page. Data cost money, and bandwidth was low, so having a simple overview of the news I wanted to see as I headed off to work in the morning was an attractive proposition. I was in a hurry. I was on a bus. I only wanted to scan headlines and snack on information. I was a walking talking mobile use case clich This was in June 2004, and the Olympics were being held in Athens . This is so long ago that, in those days, the IOC asked that you send a fax to their lawyers requesting permission before you linked to their website. The award of the 2012 Olympic Games to London was still a year away. By the time they came around this year, it felt like we had finally reached a significant tipping point with mobile. After the Games finished, new media chief for London 2012 Alex Balfour published an analysis of usage of london2012.com during the event. One very telling statistic was that 60% of visits to the site during the course of the Olympics were from a mobile or tablet device . The fact is that people love their touchscreen devices.

By any measure, Coe's life is cinematic. London 2012 was not his work alone, but he was its guiding spirit. It provided the political stage denied to him by the grubbiness of Westminster and the shambles of William Hague-era Conservatism If the reader risks backache picking up all the names Coe drops, it is because he has always gravitated towards high office. His apparent poshness is an illusion. In a passage probably designed to correct a myth or two, Coe describes his grandmother Violet as \"a true cockney\" and great-grandfather Harry Newbold as a professional gambler. His father, Peter, who oversaw his athletic rise, was a communist sympathiser who joined the Merchant Navy to avoid swearing allegiance to the Crown. When Coe failed the 11-plus, Peter declined to spoon out fees and sent him to Hugh Clopton Secondary Modern in Warwickshire. Coe writes: \"If I had ended up at a third-rate public school I would never have gone on to do what I've done.\" His battle against the elements after the family moved to Sheffield is rousing and atmospheric. His own Olympic flame was ignited by David Hemery winning gold and Sheffield's John Sherwood taking bronze in the 400m hurdles at Mexico in 1968. At Sherwood's homecoming, Coe thought: \"That could be me.\" Related Articles He found his vital athletic counterpoint in Steve Ovett, who upset the odds by winning 800m gold in Moscow: a defeat Coe avenged in the 1500m. \"The truth is that for one of the very few occasions in my life, I was afraid,\" Coe writes of the Moscow 800m.

In art lessons the teacher would tell us to divide the paper up into squares and then fill them in with certain colours. Only there were some colours, red and yellow for instance, that weren't allowed to go next to each other, and nobody ever told me why. We were also told to do a silhouette of a town by putting a wash of blue then a wash of yellow, then a wash of red, and then you inked the rest in, and every single person in the class did the same thing. There was a sense of frustration there, no question of knowing what creativity was, or that it even existed. But when you are a kid you think that's the way the world is. I had a chest of music I'd written from the age of nine, but that was a private world of writing that no one was interested in. Music was something that composers in the past did; it was a mysterious thing and slightly holy in a way, something you don't tamper with. It took me a long time to realise that I could continue doing this myself, that maybe this was something that I could really develop and make into something quite important, for me. I was brought up to be a musician, but the thing about being a performer is that creativity never comes into it. Performing is something that can be taught. The people who play in an orchestra are middlemen. I wouldn't use the word mere\" performers, but it's not the same relationship with the material - theirs is an interpretive thing, and for me, whatever I've done, there's always been this creative aspect. But I come from what used to be called a working-class background, and working-class backgrounds are all concerned with guilt and how you are going to earn your living. So I had the clarinet; that had been given to me, and that was my career. I wasn't the least bit interested in it, I wasn't good enough at it - I would have been a fairly reasonable second- rate orchestral player, I reckon. Bu"}

When last we saw Bella, the newlywed was also a newly-minted vampire and mother.

Evil comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, sounds, and smells. Many people (particularly liberals, progressives, and non-believers) are uncomfortable with the idea that monstrously evil individuals can also have the capacity to laugh, love their dogs, love their children and parents, be part of a community, and have a pleasant appearance. These people would prefer to see evil as a function of some psychological/physiological abnormality rather than attribute it to a \"choice\" for which the individual is fully responsible. In this view, evil people should have nothing in common with us; they are some bizarre, diseased branch of humanity. The reason for this delusionary view of reality is simple. It is rather frightening to confront the notion that if evil is a \"choice\" open to all human beings, then \"I\" am also capable of choosing evil. It gets worse. Just as most evil people seem absolutely convinced that they are right and are oblivious to the evil that they perpetrate, or seem totally unaware that their ideas are perverse and corrupt, then how do I really know that I am different? Maybe my ideas are perverse and corrupt, maybe my actions are reprehensible and I am oblivious and unaware of their true nature.

You can increase your chances of being chosen for the next round of interviews -- or of being offered the job -- by following up professionally. This includes writing a customized thank you note. The purpose of this often neglected bit of communication is threefold: \u0007 to remind the interviewer(s) how much you really want the job \u0007 to address any issues or gaps that may have arisen during the interview \u0007 to demonstrate that you are willing to go the extra mile, since many job hunters don't bother to send such a note (or send amateurish ones if they do) Every time you go for a job interview , ask each person you meet for their business card . This way you will know their exact names and titles and can send them an appropriate thank you. E-mailed notes are fine. For that extra special touch, consider sending an actual hand written card or note. Here is an example of a typical thank you e-mail: Dear (name of person who interviewed you), Thank you very much for taking the time to interview me on Tuesday afternoon. You gave me quite a bit of insight about your organization and were very courteous and professional. I particularly liked the way you made me feel comfortable from the start. As we discussed, my five years of experience as an Accounts Payable specialist make me an excellent choice for the position we talked about.

Since then, users of the site have been in decline as Facebook and Twitter have taken the majority of the market share due to trends having shifted to instant updates. The likes of Facebook and Twitter have also embraced comments from their users and as a result, are designed very much with usability in mind. In 2010, Myspace attempted to revitalise itself in an attempt to compete with the other social media giants, launching a new brand and some minor, but much needed updates to the website. The homepage was promising, with bold, unconventional, blocky shapes which stood out from the dull repetitiveness of other social media sites. The only real gripe was the full page images that encase the content. At first glance they look good, but then you realise you're staring at a giant full page advert -- a nod to the difficult times at Myspace HQ. Once you entered however, it was the same old layout (seen so many times before) but not done quite as well. The logo refresh was a nice idea in principle but it always looked a little awkward -- especially with the various versions floating around, some with the word 'space', some without, which showed a lack of confidence in the logo. Overall the rebrand and new site were unsuccessful due to the company failing to roll it out the whole way. Fast-forward to 2012 and another attempt by Myspace to break back into the social media lime light. This time, they appear to have done it properly! The new logo is a much more refined and modernised take on the original, and the overall feel is far more sophisticated and confident. The original logo has been updated with subtle rounded corners, and has been shrunk to fit in line with the text which helps the logo flow much better. The new website is the "}

They said that patients with macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly, would effectively have to lose the use of an eye before qualifying for therapy to save their remaining vision. Their condemnation came as the NHS drug rationing body, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommended restrictions on funding a treatment for the condition. Macular degeneration affects two million people in Britain. One version, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), can mean loss of sight in the affected eye within three to five months of diagnosis. It is the principal cause of irreversible blindness in Britain but the sight of many sufferers can be saved at a cost of around 1,500 per patient if treated early enough. AMD is caused by blood vessels growing under the central part of the retina. When they leak fluid, scar tissue forms and vision can be destroyed. Photodynamic-therapy (PDT) uses laser light to activate a drug, Visudyne, which seals the blood vessels and stops further damage. It is routinely available in most European Union countries and in North America. The treatment has been available in Britain for 18 months at 100 hospitals and 500 patients have been treated. But now NICE's ruling says Visudyne should be used to maintain vision in only one eye in cases of age-related macular degeneration - either the better seeing one or the remaining functioning one where sight has been lost in the other. The AMD Alliance, a group of six charities including the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Macular Disease Society and Age Concern, condemned the decision as 'outrageous'. Steve Winyard, of the Royal National Institute of the Blind, said he was appalled, claiming the decision amounted to saying th"}

It was so great that you wondered whether Berbatov had hauled us to the title single-handedly, and felt a bit sorry for James Collins. When Berbatov arrived, he joined a strikeforce also consisting of Ronaldo, Tevez, and Rooney. The quartet were almost never deployed together, though Ferguson did use them as a 'nuclear option' on occasion -- they were tasked with destroying Tottenham when we found ourselves 2-0 down at White Hart Lane, and the result was the best, most exciting half of football we'd played since the 7-1 versus Roma. Everything gelled that day, and United's fantastic four looked to be in serious contention for the title of 'greatest strikeforce ever put together.' It really did have everything -- physicality, work-rate, irresistible pace, guile, technique, and with all four being able to produce magic and score goals. It turned out to be a false dawn -- Ferguson, in his caution, or wisdom, rarely used all four together, and the last time we saw the combination was in a futile pursuit in the dying stages of the clash with Barcelona in Rome. Berbatov, however, stuck around, and improved in successive seasons but has still not found his place at the club. Having fallen foul of Ferguson's refusal to play him in bigger games, his confidence has wavered, and he has also bizarrely failed to attract the unconditional admiration of the fans enjoyed by the likes of Rooney. It's hard to imagine a player scoring a hat-trick, involving an overhead kick, to defeat Liverpool and attracting such limited reverence. And so, I'm prepared to admit that in a pragmatic light, a move makes a lot of sense. PSG were the club rumoured to be making the bid, and a moneyed club short on success would be ideal, as it would mean we'd get good money for an ageing stri"}

This machine is more capable at finding prostate cancer than any other type of scan - in both bones and soft tissue. Only currently available for public treatment from one place in the world. It is not likely to ever be found in your local neighbourhood clinic because it requires a cyclotron on site. It may, however, in future be found in larger centres in major hospitals. I am told that a hospital in Liverpool NSW is getting a cyclotron, but I do not know if that is true, or if they will be using it for this. Technical explanation - skip to the video link below if you aren't interested in the technology. (Jim Marshall is also not a physicist.) This cyclotron shoots beams of tiny particles at high speed. So did your old cathode-ray tube TV, at a much lower speed. The beams hit the screen and lit the dots up. So did your linear accelerator (if you had radiation), at much higher speeds than the TV. The beams hit the DNA in your cells and damaged it. Your cancer cells can't repair themselves as well as healthy cells. The cyclotron is much more powerful than either of these. It pokes tiny particles into atoms, where they stay temporarily, and then later fly out. In the process here, the cyclotron particle beam is aimed at Carbon, which then temporarily to turns into a radioactive form called Carbon 11 (C11). Radioactive C11 is attached to Choline, a naturally occurring substance from your body, and injected. Choline likes your prostate cancer cells better than other cells, and stays around the prostate cancer cells. The attached radioactive C11 sends out, or emits"}

Those are the questions everyone wants an answer to and I'm going to attempt to do just that. Digitimes recently reported that suppliers will be shipping 4 million touch (OGS) panels for the Nexus 7 in Q3 2012. Based on this, and some other data we already have, we can make an educated estimate of the Nexus 7's sales volume. Q3 2011 Production & Sales Production Volume From the Digitimes report above, TPK Holding & Wintek are the suppliers for the Nexus 7's OGS panels. The two companies shipped one million units in June and 1.4 million units in July. Including the 1.4 million units in July, they have received orders for 4 million panels in Q3 2012. These figures should be equal to the number of Nexus 7 units going into production in each of those months/quarters. We also know that the initial shipment volume delivered to Google was 600,000 units in June . We also know that Google had initially estimated sales of 3 million units by the end of the year . This means that after looking at initial demand, Google & Asus may have roughly doubled their estimates and cranked up the production volume. Using these figures with Little's Law gives us a cycle time of 2.5 weeks, i.e. it takes 2.5 weeks to produce and deliver a Nexus 7 unit to Google. Since monthly production volume stays at roughly 1-1.5 million units, production capacity is unlikely to be a constraint. Therefore, we can assume a constant cycle time and calculate the total Nexus 7 orders delivered to Google at the end of each month. Sales Estimate Once we have the Nexus 7 units available with Google, all we need to do is calculate the initial \"sell-through rate\" to get an estimate Nexus 7 sales so far. The Nexus 7 went up for sale in mid-July and the 16GB"}

This task involves understanding how they understand us, or misunderstand us. The The umbrella issue that separates us, under which the other issues stand, is the nature and authority of the Church, for all the things that Catholics believe in that Protestants don?t (e.g., the seven sacraments, transubstantiation, praying to saints, Mary?s Immaculate Conception and Assumption, papal infallibility), Catholics believe in because of the teaching authority of the Church. What is the Church, as taught in Scripture, and what is the basis of our disagreement with Protestants over its nature? I was a Protestant (Dutch Reformed) for the first twenty-one years of my life. Becoming a Catholic was one of the two best things I ever did ? that, and marrying the greatest woman in the world. Yet, I have never lost my respect and affection for the faith of my Protestant friends. This part of the book is designed to help Catholics understand the most serious Protestant objections to Catholicism and to answer them. Such a task is necessary, not optional. We have entered upon a new age of ecumenism. Battle lines are being radically clarified and redrawn. It is finally becoming clear (almost everywhere except in Northern Ireland, it seems) to both ?sides? that we have misidentified our real enemies; that an orthodox Catholic and an orthodox Protestant have far more in common than either has with a Modernist in his own church. For the questions that divide Protestants from Catholics, like whether popes are infallible, are obviously less important than the questions that divide orthodox Christians from Modernists, like whether Christ really rose from the dead. If popes are not infallible, then our certainty about dogma may be in trouble, but ?if Christ is not risen from the dead, your faith is vain and you are still in your sins.? More misunderstanding a"}

Introduction The usual explanation relates to a variable raised to the power of something. For example, 10 to the power of 2 is 100 (10 2 = 10 * 10 = 100). The 2 in this case in the exponent, hence the word exponential. Exponential functions of the nature F(x) = x n produce the classic exponential curve when plotted on a graph. \"Most people have an intuitive understanding of what it means to have exponential growth . Basically, it means that things are increasing in an out-of-control way, like a virus in a horror movie.\" This is the sort of growth that, it is generally inferred, far surpasses any other kind of growth. Is it a necessary condition, however, that the growth rate must be constant? From the endnotes for Chapter 1 of \"The Population Explosion\" (Ehrlich, 1990): \" Exponential growth occurs when the increase in population size in a given period is a constant percentage of the size at the beginning of the period. Thus a population growing at 2 percent annually or a bank account growing at 6 percent annually will be growing exponentially. \" In this article I will be challenging the assumption that exponential growth requires a constant rate. Powers Of 2 Taking \"powers of 2\" as our example, here's what happens when 1 A-Pop keeps on doubling: From 1 to 1,073,741,824 - it's pretty explosive growth, isn't it? The problem with this view is that, from a real-world perspective, the growth occurs outside of time . How long did it take to get from 1 A-Pop to 1,024 C-Pops? Without factoring in time, such representations of exponential growth have no real-world value. The solution is simple - add a constant doubling period and it's easy to calculate. If the doubling period is 25 years, each row represents 250 years of growth. Hence, 3 rows worth of growth equals 750 years of growth. This is classical exponential growth. Given that it took 750 years in this case, would you call that explosive growth? The Rule Of 70 Using the Rule Of 70 , it is commonl"}

But in order to promote and indeed foster continuing symbiosis, both borrower and lender need to operate in a nutrient-rich environment, a \"credit\" petri dish of sorts which fosters strong bones and healthy lenders and borrowers in their adult years.

In the following extract, he reveals the boozy culture that developed amongst the players that ultimately led to Andrew Flintoff's infamous 'Fredalo' incident at the World Cup in the Caribbean. A Sobering Winter There is one night of shame that will be indelibly linked with the winter of 2006/07. It has been referred to ever since simply as the pedalo night. The night that ended with Andrew Flintoff knee-deep in the Caribbean Sea at around 2am, and he and a number of other members of our World Cup squad, including yours truly, in altogether hotter water. However, this excessive night on the beer wasn't spontaneous and isolated. It had been, excuse the expression, brewing for months. There weren't many England tourists that winter who could paint a saintly picture of themselves when it came to the consumption of alcohol in Australia. When you consider that we were an international sports team, it is shocking to consider what went on during that Ashes trip. Undoubtedly, some of our guys turned to booze as a direct consequence of what was happening to us on the field against one of the best international teams in history.

(As our editor Matt Holmes turns 25 today, he's out of office and we are going to re-publish some old favourites.) With the frustrating news breaking last week that Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (based on an H.P. Lovecraft story) is 'dead', I began thinking about some of the other potentially great projects that audiences were tragically destined to never see. From further research it's clear that the major directors that have worked within the industry have abandoned vast numbers of productions that would have easily been big money makers and both critical and financial successes. Indeed, filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Orson Welles have abandoned dozens of projects, even after beginning production on some of them! Read on to discover the ten unrealised features that we'd love to have seen completed... 10. GEORGE SLUIZER'S DARK BLOOD George Sluizer's Dark Blood starred River Phoenix as Boy, a widower who lives as a hermit on a nuclear testing site. In this tale of a dystopian future, Boy waits for the end of the world while making dolls he believes have magical powers. Boy ends up helping a couple (Jonathan Pryce and Judy Davis) when their car breaks down whilst travelling through the desert. Only 11 days short of completion, the production was shut down by the tragic death of Phoenix outside the Viper Room in LA from a drug overdose. Angry at the loss of expenses through the abandonment of the production, Phoenix's grieving mother was sued by the films producers for $6 million to compensate for this, claiming that the actor had not declared his drug use! Needless to say, the case eventually collapsed. What finished portions of the film remain in existence are still entirely owned by director George Sluizer. Whilst he will never complete the film for general release now that Phoenix is gone, he has suggested that he intends to use it as footage in a documentary about "}

About anything.\" The dog's first sentence in the book is: \"Need a poo, Todd.\" Want to know more? Read the book , The Knife of Never Letting Go , by Patrick Ness. I found the book, a deeply philosophical action-packed science fiction thriller, excellent, in a nail-biting sort of way, and think it would be a popular addition to secondary libraries. This year's Newbery Award winning book existed for many years as a first sentence only. To quote the author: I had a notebook with the words, \"There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife.\" That was definitely going to be the first line. I had begun and given up on the opening many times, and suddenly I thought, I can start in the middle. So I did. So what do you think makes a great first sentence in a book? Maybe you could hold a competition with students and teachers putting forward their favourites. Perhaps your students could devise their own great first sentences. As always, we would be very excited to hear about your ideas in the comments below."}

I've tried squirting him every time he meows for a few weeks now and he just doesn't get it (this was a suggestion on another webpage)--I've tried ignoring him and that doesn't work because he just keeps meowing. It's like he's a compulsive meower and even does it while he's eating or cleaning himself! I love the cat but he needs to learn how to quiet down! Has he done this since he was a kitten?

Hyperthyroid, diabetes to name a couple may cause him to be hyper. If he is not sick it could even be his diet, not enough or an imbalance of nutrients can leave some cats feeling very unsatisfied which can lead to odd behaviour. Do be sure to check as many health causes before starting with training. It would be sad to squirt him with water if he wasn't well!

I, like many of you, read and reread the same articles, opinions, and blogs, looking for some nugget of truth or wisdom, but in reality I just haven't found what I'm looking for. I'm told to be authentic, but to keep my writing short and to the point. What if I like big words? Should I skip the authenticity, and take things down a notch? I'm told to be real, but then I'm given lessons in small talk. How real is that? What if I just enjoy talking to people? Does it matter if you know who you are online? Yes, but not for the reasons many people might be telling you. It matters not so much to stake a claim on a few pixels of space, or to gain the title of \"expert.\" You need to know who you are to be effective. The truth of the matter is that, as Seth Godin says it, \"All marketers are liars.\" I don't care if you're selling a product, service, or by way of saying you're \"real and genuine\" or you're \"building community,\" you're trying to make money. You're selling something. That's OK, a lot of people are doing it really well , and I benefit -- you benefit. What turns me off is when I realize I've been daft to listen. We talk about \"content\" but don't challenge each other to think. So the challenge I give to you (and myself) today is this: Define your own voice, and speak from it. Be OK with the fact that it will grow and change over time. Understand that some people will like it, others won't. Overall, keep learning; keep experimenting. Eventually you'll have a stage -- you'll have an audience. The best part is they'll be yours, or your brand's, not someone else's. If you need some inspiration, take a look at Lauren Luke , a single mum from England with \"not many mates, and not much confidence\" who's found her voice on YouTube, and as a result of being real, an audience of millions."}

Dr. Vinnie is not a Doctor of Psychology or Psychiatry, but he did have a sign on the wall of his office that read \"Don't Worry!

I began to explain that since last Wednesday I had been seeing visions of Karl Rove's white board as I slept. I told the doctor that Rove seemed to be talking about Ohio and how the southern tip of Hamilton County had multiplied into millions of Republican votes while Cleveland was due a lake-effect snowstorm off Lake Erie. As a result, the President would get 3.2 percent fewer votes than in 2008 and Romney would whup up on him in the great state of Ohio.

Leaders raise their arms together during the group picture for the BRICS 2012 Summit in New Delhi, India (AP Photo/Saurabh Das). There is an ongoing debate about the logic of using acronyms for clustering ascendant or rising states. The BRICS -- a concept originally formulated by Goldman Sachs as BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and translated into action through summits at both the level of foreign ministers and state leaders since 2009 -- has gained the most prominence. On top of application through various criteria of economic capacity (gross domestic product, rates of economic growth, foreign direct investment etc), there is also the image of the extended BRICS (the BRICs plus South Africa) animating an impressive form of soft, symbolic or cultural power. At first glance the soft power argument seems to have some attractive validity. This is especially true of the BRICS pushing to host major sporting/cultural events. The 2008 Beijing Olympics stands out, but the collective desire of the BRICS to attract attention concerning their rise can also be seen by South Africa's successful hosting of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Brazil's grabbing both the 2016 Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Russia's hosting of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and (although more problematically) India's hosting of the 2010 Commonwealth games. Yet the limits of any clustering of the BRICS can be seen by two very different standards of performance. One limitation, as I see it, is the difference in terms of performance.

Psoriasis is a common skin condition, characterised by red scaly thickened patches (plaques). It ofen affects the scalp. Scalp psoriasis may occur in isolation or with any other form of psoriasis. The back of the head is a common site for psoriasis, but multiple discrete areas of the scalp or the whole scalp may be affected. Scalp psoriasis is characterised by thick silvery-white scale over well-defined red thickened skin. Psoriasis may extend slightly beyond the hairline ( facial psoriasis ). Scalp psoriasis, even though often adequately camouflaged by the hair, is often a source of social embarrassment due to flaking of the scale and severe 'dandruff'. Scalp psoriasis may not cause any symptoms at all or may be extremely itchy. It tends to be a chronic problem, lasting many years, although it often fluctuates in severity and extent. In very severe cases there may be some temporary mild localised hair loss but scalp psoriasis does not cause permanent balding. Sebopsoriasis Sebopsoriasis is an overlap between psoriasis and another common skin condition, seborrhoeic dermatitis . There tends to be less silvery scale than psoriasis and more yellowish, greasy scale. Sebopsoriasis tends to localise to the scalp, face and anterior chest in a similar pattern to that seen in seborrhoeic dermatitis. But sebo-psoriasis has a deeper red colour, more defined margins and a thicker scale than typically seen in seborrhoeic dermatitis alone. It is also less likely to clear up with anti-dandruff shampoo. Pityriasis amiantacea Pityriasis amiantacea is characterised by thick, yellow-white scales densely coating the scalp skin and adhering to the hairs as they exit the scalp. The scales are arranged in an overlapping manner like tiles on a roof or flakes of asbestos, hence the name. The underlying scalp skin may appear normal, aside from the scale, or may be reddened or scaly. Pityriasis amiantacea is often present without any obvious underlying"}

More often than not this is because you had a particularly late night which has left your body crying out for more sleep. On the other hand, sometimes you may be getting to bed in good time, thinking you'll get a good night's sleep, and yet when the morning arrives you still feel like every waking thought and movement is a real effort. Here's 10 tips to help you beat fatigue: Get enough sleep It may be stating the obvious, but to avoid tiredness you should ensure you get enough sleep! Remember that your body needs sleep in order to recharge -- and staying up and watching a movie which starts at midnight isn't going to help! If you are having any trouble sleeping, then aim to have a better sleep routine such as going to bed and getting up at the same time. You could also improve your sleeping environment by making sure your bedroom is quiet, dark and comfortable. Also, by using your bedroom for sleep alone, your body will come to associate it with sleeping rather than reading or watching TV. Try to avoid stress Stress is one of the most common reasons for feeling tired -- so beating stress will naturally help to alleviate your tiredness. There are several ways in which to tackle stress, but the most important thing to do is identify what is causing your stress in the first place. It may be work that is the main cause of your stress -- perhaps because of bad work relationships, long hours, or an unfulfilling job. If that's the case, then look at your options about how you can improve the situation. Also, make sure you switch off from work in your leisure time, an"}

The All Saints Church in Lawrence is one of five Anglican churches in the Maclean parish. All Saints warden Terry Bird said the Grafton diocese had ordered a review of Maclean Parish and wanted one, possibly two, local churches to close. \"As in many other country dioceses, the Grafton diocese has requested the Maclean Parish review the number of centres and reduce the number by at least one,\" Mr Bird said. \"As members of our beautiful riverside community are aware, we have a solid foundational history in the Lower Clarence.\" Mr Bird and other members of the congregation have arranged a public meeting to be held this Saturday and are calling for public support. They will present a petition at the meeting, which at the moment has the signatures of more than 100 people. \"We'll be going down to the election polling booths on Saturday to get as many signatures as possible,\" said Mr Bird. He said there had been \"talk\" the diocese was looking to close some churches for more than a year. \"It seems to have come to a head with calls for these meetings,\" he said. Mr Bird said All Saints had helped the diocese cope with financial problems arising from building the Clarence Valley Anglican School senior campus. \"We donated a block of land we had at the school to the Bishop's Appeal,\" he said. Grafton Diocese Archdeacon Greg Ezzy will be at Saturday's meeting to discuss the issue with parishioners. \"Faithful parishioners have enjoyed many years of worship, service, and fellowship together,\" Mr Bird said. \"The community has gathered to share weddings, baptisms, and funerals through the decades. \"We in Lawrence need your support to keep our church open; not for just our generation, but to consider our growing community and those of future generations.\" Mr Bird said the original All Saints Church in Lawrence was built in 1868, while the existing heritage-liste"}

He seems to have settled down to a level of work and prominence of the sort that he had before Lakeland with some minor changes. He's not based in Canada any more, and ministers here infrequently. Ministering anywhere near his old ministry base, in Abbotsford B.C., near where his kids may still, presumably live, seems to be something he won't be doing soon. He's keeping the habit of not ministering in many big Cities, with the attendant possibility of media coverage. Rather, he works close enough to cities and airports so that a fan, if they are determined enough, can come see him. He seems to be ministering outside of North America with the same frequency as he did before he became famous to the average Christian. But his history is tagging along behind him like a little puppy as readers of a small English newspaper realized about a week or so ago. I'm guessing that this comes from the local newspaper in Croydon , England. Croydon is one of the southern suburbs of London, inside the region of London. Bentley is scheduled to hold a series of meetings there from August 30 to September 1. And I think, judging by what they wrote, the reporter will be waiting for Bentley when they show up. There are no new quotes from Bentley, but the reporter has done their homework. They refer, high up in the story, to Bentley's claims to heal people by beating them up and his time in jail as a teen after he molested a child. The \"face-kicking faith healer\" reference relates to one night at Lakeland, when Todd Bentley started talking about the odd things that \"God\" would have him do when praying for people on other occasions. It's probably his most infamous clip on YouTube, in various forms. The reporter could have easily quoted this particular video clip where at 0:40, Bentley "}

Experiments in political subjectivity The possibility of conceiving practices of citizenship after orientalism points to experiments that uncover, rearticulate and provoke subjugated forms of politics. Through addressing the intersections between orientalism, colonialism and citizenship (panel 1), exploring possibilities of democratic politics for decolonizing citizenship (panel 2) and troubling universal claims to rights (panel 3), we ask what images of citizenship are emerging in relation to the process of deorientalization? It is this experimentation itself, rather than its outcomes, that constitutes 'citizenship after orientalism' as a field of investigation. The Oecumene Project team members discuss their first collective publication, a double Special Issue of Citizenship Studies entitled, 'Citizenship After Orientalism: An Unfinished Project.' Published half way through the European Research Council funded project, this is its first statement on how citizenship has been understood as a narrowly western concept and what techniques researchers can use to write about citizenship after orientalism. With a global reach and a blend of approaches from anthropology to legal studies, from history to sociology, from postcolonial to European studies, the Special Issue shows how widely orientalism has shaped our understanding of the citizen and how innovative the field can be once we attempt to write about citizenship after orientalism."}

Sara el-Yafi is deeply offended, even outraged by the Israeli buffet menu, and Harvard rushes to accommodate her. Islamic supremacists such as Hamas-linked CAIR play the outrage card again and again in the U.S. because they know that when they do, frightened dhimmi officials will hasten to give them everything they want. \"Harvard 'deeply troubled' by row over Israeli buffet,\" by Charles Bybelezer for the Jerusalem Post , November 9 (thanks to Benedict): Harvard Business School is \"deeply troubled\" for having offended Arab sensibilities due to the mischaracterization of various foods appearing on the menu of the dining room's Israeli Mezze Station, Brian Kenny, chief marketing and communications officer of the school, was quoted by Al-Arabiya as saying Friday. The controversy over the Israeli food station arose after Lebanese Harvard graduate Sara el-Yafi on October 28 posted to her Facebook page a letter of protest to the university describing the Israeli buffet's menu as an affront to Arabs, as such foods as humous and couscous are not of Israeli origin. \"That 'Israeli Mezze Station\" is the ultimate multicultural, multireligious 'f*** you' in the face of ALL Arabs at once from North Africa to the Levant,\" el- Yafi wrote. \"Israel already has a hard time keeping face in the Arab world for the way it has 'appropriated' its lands since 1948, don't make it worse for them by having them appropriate other peoples' foods as well,\" she added. El-Yafi also pointed out that haloumi cheese is in fact \"Cypriot,\" and therefore \"until Cyprus becomes another conquered Israeli territory, haloumi is considered NOT Israeli.\" She concluded that at the very least the buffet should be renamed \"Mediterranean Mezze Station.\" In response to el-Yafi's Facebook protest, which as of Friday had garnered more than 4,500 \"likes,\" Kenny reportedly said that \"we are deeply troubled that we offend"}
