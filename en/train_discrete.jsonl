The problem begins with a lack of awareness about disabilities and disability issues. One factor that was brought up repeatedly was the negative impact of highly visible disabilities. Some participants noted that people often have a fear of being around persons with highly visible disabilities. \"People just don?t want to look at us. They don?t want us around as reminders that this could be them at some point in the future.\" As well, some highly visible disabilities can mask the true potential and capabilities of persons with disabilities. As a result, negative judgements are placed upon individuals because their speech or appearance is not \"normal.\" \"People think I?m drunk because of the way my eyes look.\" \"People look at my disability and they hear my speech. I can?t leave those things in the waiting room when I go for an interview. Whenever I have actually got a job, I always had positive feedback. But they were all short-term jobs. Attitude is my biggest barrier.\" Women with learning disabilities commented that they were typically treated like children and not given credit when they had performed well on the job because attitudes in their workplace were such that no one believed that they could have actually done the job on their own. \"When people asked: ?Did you do that? Who helped you?? It really hurt. You wonder if you should tell anyone that you have a learning disability. If they know, they might be able to give you the supports on the job. But if you do tell them, they never take your abilities seriously again.\" Women with developmental disabilities face enormous attitudinal barriers. They also feel that they are \"treated like children\" or aren?t \"trusted.\" However, when given the opportunity and the right job, these women are quite capable of working in the paid labour market and living independently. \"I used to work in a sheltered workshop. I never thought I would ever have a real job. Then I began what was supposed to be a two-month contract. But they renewed and renewed ? it?s nine years later and I?m still employed.\" Those who don?t have a visible disability also experience negative attitudes. When it came to matters involving the labour market and social services, many of the focus group participants voiced the belief that while social attitudes toward persons with disabilities improved over the 1980s, they have deteriorated over the course of the 1990s. \"It breaks my heart that society has devolved into a very hateful society. I?m concerned about the future for all of us.\" \"When employment gets tight, prejudices surface.\" Women in our focus groups also noted that public attitudes and their own situation had an impact on their self-esteem. This can often lead to low self-esteem, lack of confidence and poor performance in job interviews. \"I had to fight to get homecare to come in twice a week to help me have a bath. Do you know what it?s like going for a job interview a few days after your last bath?\" While both women and men with disabilities face these attitudinal barriers, women also fight gender bias. Although women with disabilities have a high degree of financial responsibility within their households, they report that employers often still believe that they are being taken care of by someone else and don?t really need to work for pay. Sexism interacts with disability in other ways. One woman who required a special seat to sit in her wheelchair had her request to a local service club turned down because \"they said that they only provide assistance to men.\" Visible minority women with disabilities often feel that they have an additional mark against them. Several in our focus groups mentioned that they felt racial discrimination compounded the challenges of being female and having a disability. However, they were reluctant to attribute past negative experiences solely to racial discrimination. Some felt that they had so many factors working against them that they couldn?t be sure how much of their situation could be attributed to their race. \"Is it because of my language, my race, my disability, or because I?m a woman? Why am I not being hired?\" One of the most illustrative examples of the complex interplay of attitudes toward race, disability, and gender can be found in ERDCO?s 1996 study, entitled Including Us . . . Ethno Racial People with Disabilities speak out on issues of race and disability : One woman?s horrifying story illustrates the multiple oppressions which women are often subjected to. As a Muslim woman, she adhered to certain norms of modesty and covered her hair. Some of her female co-workers wanted to see her without her hijab (head coverin"}

For nearly all of my adult digital life, people have been telling me that next year is going to be the big breakthrough year for the mobile web. One year I got so excited about this that I even taught myself WML - a mark-up language somewhere between HTML and 1960s computer punch-cards. I thought I was going to be the most employable developer in town. I worked for the BBC at the time , but on my Sony Ericsson T-610 it took ages to navigate through the real mobile site to the sections I knew I wanted to read. I wrote a script that took RSS feeds from some BBC Sport sections I was interested in, and then published the headlines and links out as a WML page. Data cost money, and bandwidth was low, so having a simple overview of the news I wanted to see as I headed off to work in the morning was an attractive proposition. I was in a hurry. I was on a bus. I only wanted to scan headlines and snack on information. I was a walking talking mobile use case clich This was in June 2004, and the Olympics were being held in Athens . This is so long ago that, in those days, the IOC asked that you send a fax to their lawyers requesting permission before you linked to their website. The award of the 2012 Olympic Games to London was still a year away. By the time they came around this year, it felt like we had finally reached a significant tipping point with mobile. After the Games finished, new media chief for London 2012 Alex Balfour published an analysis of usage of london2012.com during the event. One very telling statistic was that 60% of visits to the site during the course of the Olympics were from a mobile or tablet device . The fact is that people love their touchscreen devices. I've seen a survey suggesting that most Europeans are never more than a metre from their phones -- i.e. they carry them around with them all day, then put them down beside them at their bedside when they sleep. You know, in case they need to check their text messages at 4am. And we are now conditioned to expect touch. I keep making myself look ridiculous trying to buy tickets on various European urban transport systems by resolutely stabbing my fingers at some screen whilst ignoring the perfectly obvious buttons located next to it. Touchscreen apps at the Guardian Over the course of my time at the Guardian I worked on several apps aimed at touchscreen devices, including the first Guardian iPhone app. A small team worked hard to bring a version of the Guardian to the phone that felt more naturally designed for the device, and to give a better user experience than the standard free mobile site. The app originally had a one-off download charge. Prior to launch, a lot of the wisdom in the market was that you couldn't charge for general purpose news apps -- and you certainly couldn't charge for them if all of the content was available for free via the web browser on the same phone. That \"wisdom\" was wrong, and the app was a success, to the extent that when we were running user testing sessions prior to developing version two, our own users were telling us that it was too cheap, and that they would have happily paid a subscription. User testing was an important part of ensuring that the product met the needs of users, and that the design and functionality are easily understood. The Guardian iPhone app I also worked on testing for the Guardian iPad edition. I think it is a beautifully designed reading experience on the device , but that doesn't seem to have translated to mass take-up of the app. User testing prior to release showed up some flaws in the product proposition for the early adopter techie crowd -- at the time of launch I described the testing on this blog as \"showing a family saloon to some boy racers. They would grudgingly admit that it had four wheels and got you from A to B, but they weren't excited about it, and didn't find it digital enough.\" On that occasion, the business opted to take small details from the user testing sessions -- for example adding tiny chevrons on every article to indicate that you can swipe from left to right -- but not to fundamentally alter the static edition-based premise of the Guardian on iPad that many users were finding unsatisfactory. The Guardian iPad app features little chevrons to indicate where the user can swipe We need to really understand our users, not just second-guess them. If you've never had the opportunity to observe a user testing session, I urge you to do so. Watching someone struggle to use the simplest of products you've had a hand in building reminds you that perfectly formed designs don't just fall out of your head. And people aren't always running for buses or sitting on trains when using their smartphones or tablets. The idea that because a device is mobile it is always used in a mob"}

Bicycle NSW member Martin Stock is on the ground in London working for Channel Nine on the Olympic boradcast. He was kind enough to email us some details of his experiences in the city that all the world is watching... No photo tonight but instead, an observation... After a very long and stressful nine hours on air I got back to my hotel room. I switched on the TV and and heard the BBC news headline stories which included, among many other Olympic headlines, the predicted transport nightmares did not materialise on the first day of events clashing with a normal business day. Amazingly, they included two sound bytes - the first from the British Prime Minister who caught the Tube to work and, secondly, the (admittedly nutty, promoter of the free bike scheme) London Mayor, typically dishevelled and wearing a bike helmet, who rode his bike to work. I was astounded that the two most powerful people in the City/Country didn't just talk about it: they walked (/rode the bike and train) the walk. I know that Sydney had a great outcome with transport during the Olympics, but I was really impressed with the politicians here. They have really followed through with the message even in a city that relies so heavily on their non-car transport system as they do here. I appreciated it and I suppose it was something that I hope we should all appreciate and aspire to. 'Nuff said. Anyway, another early start, off to bed. P.S. The car drivers and cyclists get on so well here - it's amazing and heartening to watch. P.P.S. Having said all this I still hate having to catch the hot, crowded and cramped Tube in peak hour... The special Olympic media transport busses are much more comfortable and direct for our needs! My point is in this person entire observation/experience , he didn't make the observation that the helmet use was discretionary (as you can see from the cyclists streaming  past on the rowing competitions) \" London Mayor, typically dishevelled and choosing/opting to wear a bike helmet, who rode his bike to work\"  would be a far more accurate observation, don't you think ?\""}

This autobiography affirms him as a man of the people rather than a son of privilege. No living Briton has covered so much social ground, from runner-geek to Conservative apparatchik to messianic transformer of London at the triumphant 2012 Games. By any measure, Coe's life is cinematic. London 2012 was not his work alone, but he was its guiding spirit. It provided the political stage denied to him by the grubbiness of Westminster and the shambles of William Hague-era Conservatism If the reader risks backache picking up all the names Coe drops, it is because he has always gravitated towards high office. His apparent poshness is an illusion. In a passage probably designed to correct a myth or two, Coe describes his grandmother Violet as \"a true cockney\" and great-grandfather Harry Newbold as a professional gambler. His father, Peter, who oversaw his athletic rise, was a communist sympathiser who joined the Merchant Navy to avoid swearing allegiance to the Crown. When Coe failed the 11-plus, Peter declined to spoon out fees and sent him to Hugh Clopton Secondary Modern in Warwickshire. Coe writes: \"If I had ended up at a third-rate public school I would never have gone on to do what I've done.\" His battle against the elements after the family moved to Sheffield is rousing and atmospheric. His own Olympic flame was ignited by David Hemery winning gold and Sheffield's John Sherwood taking bronze in the 400m hurdles at Mexico in 1968. At Sherwood's homecoming, Coe thought: \"That could be me.\" Related Articles He found his vital athletic counterpoint in Steve Ovett, who upset the odds by winning 800m gold in Moscow: a defeat Coe avenged in the 1500m. \"The truth is that for one of the very few occasions in my life, I was afraid,\" Coe writes of the Moscow 800m. The win that followed was his great catharsis. Early political awareness was expressed in a boyhood scrapbook of newspaper cuttings. He was radicalised by the three-day week of the Seventies and what he calls the \"drudgery of municipal socialism\" in Sheffield, yet sympathised with the striking miners, on whose union tracks he had run: \"I remember being at a party once, full of just the kind of braying Sloanes I loathed. The conversation turned to how great it was watching the miners getting hammered every night on the news. 'You have no idea what life in these communities is like, have you? No idea.' And I left.\" These egalitarian instincts underpinned his Olympic mission. They also lent him common cause with Hague, who made him his chief of staff and judo partner. \"We were hewn from the same South Yorkshire landscape,\" Coe explains. He is a good anecdotalist. The best of his political yarns is his long war against a red-top \"Krusty the Clown\" (from The Simpsons ) who had been stalking Hague at photo-ops. The pair finished up wrestling on the ground at a seaside resort. Krusty finally gasped: \"OK, That's it. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not paid enough.\" An extra-marital affair is confessed to and Coe is unbeatable on the dark politics of bidding. Much chortling has accompanied the revelation that Cherie Blair rounded on Jacques Chirac for his dismissive comment about British cooking. \"She was at him like a banshee and he couldn't get out of that building fast enough,\" Coe writes. Her husband tells him: \"The thing about my wife is that when she says something, she really means it.\" In the doomed 2018 World Cup bidding race, Fifa's president Sepp Blatter instructs our author: \"Your game is run by idiots.\" Without Coe there would have been no London 2012. His marshalling of the bid was decisive and his political nous cleared a path through the thickets of media negativity. In his closing speech he cited a consultant anaesthetist at St Mary's Paddington who had worked on the night of the 7/7 bombings as well as at the Games. He told Coe: \"For me this is closure. I have seen the worst of mankind and now I've seen the best of mankind.\" The teller of this tale had climbed his political Olympus."}

In art lessons the teacher would tell us to divide the paper up into squares and then fill them in with certain colours. Only there were some colours, red and yellow for instance, that weren't allowed to go next to each other, and nobody ever told me why. We were also told to do a silhouette of a town by putting a wash of blue then a wash of yellow, then a wash of red, and then you inked the rest in, and every single person in the class did the same thing. There was a sense of frustration there, no question of knowing what creativity was, or that it even existed. But when you are a kid you think that's the way the world is. I had a chest of music I'd written from the age of nine, but that was a private world of writing that no one was interested in. Music was something that composers in the past did; it was a mysterious thing and slightly holy in a way, something you don't tamper with. It took me a long time to realise that I could continue doing this myself, that maybe this was something that I could really develop and make into something quite important, for me. I was brought up to be a musician, but the thing about being a performer is that creativity never comes into it. Performing is something that can be taught. The people who play in an orchestra are middlemen. I wouldn't use the word mere\" performers, but it's not the same relationship with the material - theirs is an interpretive thing, and for me, whatever I've done, there's always been this creative aspect. But I come from what used to be called a working-class background, and working-class backgrounds are all concerned with guilt and how you are going to earn your living. So I had the clarinet; that had been given to me, and that was my career. I wasn't the least bit interested in it, I wasn't good enough at it - I would have been a fairly reasonable second- rate orchestral player, I reckon. But I wasn't in a position to say \"I want to be a composer\" when I became a music student, because you couldn't earn your living doing that; it wasn't what people did. Consequently, when I went to music school there was a real problem. I felt very much at odds because when I was writing music I was thinking maybe I should be practising, and when I was practising I thought there were more interesting things to do. I closed in on myself so far as my composition was concerned. My student persona was of a rather irresponsible wind player - I just don't think I was a very good student. My heart wasn't in playing the clarinet, and I had also decided that, in a sense, my student life was a waste of time. I was neither one thing nor the other; I hadn't made the big decision, and I didn't really write any music for five years. But that period when I wasn't writing wasn't barren. I didn't have writer's block. It was a conscious decision not to do it. I was trying to find the courage not to play the clarinet. I don't think I was scared; I'm not sure what it was. I felt that the time wasn't right; I was biding my time. The full story is that I'd won a four-year open music scholarship when I left school, and I did three years of that in Manchester, then I did two years' National Service in the Army, and when I came out I had a year left so I went to London, to the Royal Academy. And it was there that I met Alan Hacker, a wonderful clarinet player and a natural musician, and I heard him play the Clarinet Quintet of Mozart, and at last I realised that I would never be a clarinettist. He played like an angel. I'd heard some fairly dashing clarinettists in my life, but Alan was so brilliant, I knew I would never be within light years of that. It was a watershed. I sold my clarinets. I was doing a bit of clarinet teaching once a week at a girls' school, and I sold them to a pupil. God, I tell you, it was a permanent release in my life. I was completely relieved. It's quite something that sometimes I feel happy and I don't know what it is and then I think, I know what it is; I don't play the clarinet any more. I felt I had cast off a lot of things that needed to be cast off; there was this feeling of being welded to the clarinet, that it was going to be my living, but I'd got rid of it, and it was a terribly liberating thing. And as one thing goes out of focus, another comes into focus, and in this case it was the possibility of being a composer, the confidence of thinking I had the wherewithal. It was getting towards the end of that year, and at the same time I wrote a piece of music off the top of my head called \"Refrains and Choruses\", the first piece of music I'd written since being a schoolboy.

With the Canadian dollar having recorded a sizeable appreciation this year, it should come as no surprise that there has been renewed interest among experts and policy makers in the movement in the Canada-U.S. exchange rate and the effects that this movement has had on bilateral trade and the overall Canadian economy.  Not a day seems to go by without some discussion of this important topic in the media, in the business community, in political circles, and amongst the general public. Three factors can explain much of this interest.  The first is the sheer rapidity of the dollar's climb, with the currency having risen by about 20% from January to October.  While the dollar also experienced significant growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the pace of the rise during that period was much less pronounced, enabling Canadian businesses to adjust much more readily.  This time, in the face of a sharper rise, the business response has been more challenging. A second factor is the growing dependence of Canada on trade with the United States, a subject that the Committee has already analyzed extensively in its June 2003 Uncertain Access:  The Consequences Of U.S. Security And Trade Actions For Canadian Trade Policy report.  Canada-U.S. currency fluctuations matter more now than they used to, given this heightened dependence. Finally, any analysis of the effects of a currency appreciation of the scope and speed of the one that we are now experiencing must not be limited to its impacts on international trade, notwithstanding trade's importance to the domestic economy.  This currency \"shock\" affects all of us, through its impact on Canada's economic growth, on inflation and the monetary policy that the Bank of Canada implements to restrain it, on the domestic employment situation and on the productivity of the economy. This report begins with a discussion of the trends that have been observed in the dollar's movement, both recent and historical.  The determinants of these currency fluctuations over time will then be explained, and consideration given to both internal and external influences on the dollar's recent appreciation.  A second element is an assessment of the economic impacts of the dollar's rise, with the trade impact being reviewed from both a general and sectoral point of view.  The report concludes with a discussion of the appropriateness of the existing exchange rate regime in Canada. The Canadian dollar has appreciated sharply since the beginning of 2003.  Valued at under 64 cents US in the first week of the year, the dollar has risen by roughly 20% through October and is trading at over 76 cents US -- its highest level in nearly ten years.  As Ted Carmichael (Economist, J.P. Morgan Securities Canada) testified, this surge in the value of the Canadian dollar may be unprecedented in the history of Canada's floating exchange rate."}

But the sparkliness of those vampires is set to dim, as The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 closes out the five-film series this Friday, November 16th. The new film concludes the two-part adaptation of the last novel in Stephenie Meyer 's story spanning four bestselling novels.  When last we saw Bella, the newlywed was also a newly-minted vampire and mother.  As she adapted to her new supernatural lifestyle in Breaking Dawn - Part 2 , the nefarious Volturi are mistakenly informed that she and Edward's child, Renesmee, is a volatile and dangerous Immortal Child.  In order to protect their progeny, who was actually born a vampire, from the Volturi, Bella, Edward, and the Cullens must marshal a fighting force of vampires and werewolves, setting the stage for a climactic final battle. At the Los Angeles press day for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 , IAR was one of many international entertainment outlets on hand to discuss the sequel with the cast and principal creative figures. Kristen Stewart , Robert Pattinson , and Taylor Lautner were on hand to enthusiastically discuss the latest entry in this franchise and the conclusion of a ridiculously successful pop culture phenomenon. This movie marks a big change for Bella as a character as she shifts from human to vampire.  Having been something of an outsider amongst both her human friends and the vampiric Cullen family for four movies, Bella is now adapting to having superpowers and a thirst for blood.  Her new abilities meant a new challenge for Stewart , who was called upon to perform complicated stunts for action sequences. \"I broke my thumb maybe like the first or second day of our really sort of intense action-y type stuff,\" she recalled. \"So that was really frustrating, but it was fun. I think I got a little taste of it. I got a little taste of it when we were in Italy just like the physicality was so important then and it finally became important again. And I don't know, what can I say? I think I'd been on the sidelines for so long, just itching, going like, 'God, I think I could do that pretty well. I think I could do that pretty well. I think those contacts are going to look pretty cool.' No sorry. I was like bursting to do it. And which I think is probably why I broke my thumb. I was a little overzealous.\" For Lautner , as well, the story finds his character in new territory.  After being one-third of a love triangle for several films, Jacob Black's focus in now on protecting Renesmee, played by Mackenzie Foy .  In Breaking Dawn - Part 1 , Jacob imprinted on the newborn, devoting himself to her well-being entirely.  In depicting the relationship between Jacob and Renesmee, Lautner was aware of the delicacy of their dynamic, saying, \"It's a fine line and I was worried about it. We were very fortunate to have Stephenie Meyer , the author, on set with us for these last two movies, and I definitely had quite a bit of conversations with her. There's really nobody better to ask about it than her. And she basically told me, I mean, 'Stop over-complicating it.' She's like, 'Just think here and now that's all you really have to focus on, and it's simple.' She said, 'It's a lifelong bond between two people and that's it. At this point the girl's like what, ten years old? So it's more of a protective thing like a brother sister and that's really all it is.' And I couldn't allow myself to think ahead, and go beyond that. So that's kind of the zone I had to stay in. And I think Bill , our director, did a tremendous job with it because it is delicate, and I think the fans are going to be happy with it. I think it came together well.\" Playing an immortal vampire has never been simple for Pattinson , and the obstacles of playing Edward Cullen in the fifth film were largely the same in past movies, according to the actor. \"It's a kind of a strange part,\" he explained. \"Because on one hand, a lot of the audience projects their idea of Edward on to him without, you know, it doesn't matter what he is, it's like they want him to be a certain way, and then my kind of instincts to try and play it, to try and find the fallibility in him, and the weaknesses. So it's you're trying to play both these things at the same time, and it becomes very strange, I mean, because you're trying to play someone who is seen by a lot of people as being like this perfect thing, but what is that? It doesn't really mean anything, and so you're trying to play an archetype on one hand, and then the character on the other. So I kind of felt insanely frustrated right up until the last shot, and then it ended.\" While Pattinson was playing a vampire from day one, Stewart had the benefit of establishing her character as a human and developing her for four films, then playing the transition, as she said, \"I was really lucky to ha"}

As more couples shun weddings, children are increasingly likely to live with unmarried parents as married ones. Some 8,000 same-sex couples now have children, the Office for National Statistics said, while almost 8million people are living alone. The figures highlight the continuing decline in popularity of marriage, despite claims that it provides the most stable background for children and attempts to promote it by leading politicians including David Cameron. The ONS's bulletin , published on Thursday, shows that in 2011 there were 17.9m families in Britain. Of these, 7.6m were married or in civil partnerships and childless, while 4.5m had children under 16. Related Articles But although married couples \"are still the most common family type\", their number is declining as more relationships break down and fewer couples choose to wed. Over the past decade the number of married couples fell by 262,000 to 12m, while the number of cohabiting couples rose from 2.1m to 2.9m. There are now 1.8m young people living with unmarried parents. The ONS said the types of families with children \"changed significantly\" between 2001 and 2011, with 62 per cent of children now living with married parents, 14 per cent with cohabiting couples and 24 per cent with a single parent. The number of lone parents with children has risen \"steadily but significantly\" from 1.7m to 1.96m, rounded up to 2m by the ONS. Almost all (92 per cent) of these single parents were women: \"Women are more likely to take the main caring responsibilities for any children when relationships break down, and therefore become lone parents.\" Increasing numbers of same-sex couples are living together (63,000) and entering into civil partnerships (59,000), with 8,000 said to have children. More couples had one child rather than two or more in 2011 compared with a decade ago, but the ONS said this could just be down to women \"postponing their childbearing to older ages\". Overall, there were 26.3m households in Britain in 2011, up 7 per cent since 2001 as a result of immigration and people living in smaller units. The proportion of households containing just one person rose by some 700,000 over the past decade, to reach 7.7m. Among 16 to 64 year-olds, more men live alone as they are more likely to never marry. But over 65 the \"pattern is reversed\", partly because women tend to live longer. Adults in the \"1960s baby boom generation\", aged 45 to 64, have fuelled the rise in the number of single-person households in recent years as fewer people from that generation have chosen to marry,"}

He was an early medical pioneer in \"after-birth abortions.\" His groundbreaking research was conducted at his world renowned clinic in Auschwitz, Poland. Evil comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, sounds, and smells. Many people (particularly liberals, progressives, and non-believers) are uncomfortable with the idea that monstrously evil individuals can also have the capacity to laugh, love their dogs, love their children and parents, be part of a community, and have a pleasant appearance. These people would prefer to see evil as a function of some psychological/physiological abnormality rather than attribute it to a \"choice\" for which the individual is fully responsible. In this view, evil people should have nothing in common with us; they are some bizarre, diseased branch of humanity. The reason for this delusionary view of reality is simple. It is rather frightening to confront the notion that if evil is a \"choice\" open to all human beings, then \"I\" am also capable of choosing evil. It gets worse. Just as most evil people seem absolutely convinced that they are right and are oblivious to the evil that they perpetrate, or seem totally unaware that their ideas are perverse and corrupt, then how do I really know that I am different? Maybe my ideas are perverse and corrupt, maybe my actions are reprehensible and I am oblivious and unaware of their true nature. Let's face it, just about everybody thinks they are right. \"All of a man's ways are proper in his own eyes...\" (Proverbs) No, anyone is capable of choosing evil, even those who seem to be perfectly normal and just like us. Let us then confront evil in the form of two young smiling faces; one a handsome young man, Dr. Alberto Giubilini;  the other a rather pretty young woman, Dr. Francesca Minerva.  Both hold PhD's in philosophy from prestigious universities. At some unknown twist or turn along their path to academic \"enlightenment\" Dr.'s Giubilini and Minerva traded in their souls and humanity for some perverse and profoundly evil ideology they call \"ethics.\" They are co-authors of an article in The Journal of Medical Ethics (2/23/12), entitled, \"After-birth abortion: Why should the baby live?\" They argue -- quite logically and coherently -- that if it is justifiable to \"kill a human fetus\" then it is also justifiable to \"kill a newborn human\" because \"merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life.\" Infants are not \"persons\" in the sense that they have a \"moral right to life...in these cases, since non-persons have no moral rights to life, there are no reasons for banning after-birth abortions.\"  (For those who are unfamiliar with the term \"after-birth abortion,\" it used to be called \"infanticide\" or \"first-degree murder.\") Please note that Minerva and Guibilini apply this principle to fully healthy babies who are simply unwanted by their parents. However, they do raise the question of putting the baby up for adoption: \"Why should we kill a healthy newborn when giving it up for adoption would not breach anyone's rights but possibly increase the happiness of people involved (adopters and adoptee)?\" Dr. Francesca Minverva, this deceptively beautiful smile may be the last thing a newborn baby ever sees. Dr. Peter Singer, \"bioethicist\" at Princeton University is the intellectual father of the animal rights movement. He has stated that \"nothing is intrinsically wrong.\" Sometimes Satan comes as a man who loves animals. They provide us with an interesting answer to this question: \"On this perspective, the interests of the actual people involved matter, and among these interests, we also need to consider the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving her child up for adoption...we are suggesting that, if interests of actual people should prevail, then after-birth abortion should be considered a permissible option.\" (Makes perfect sense to me.) As could be expected, the suggestion that it is perfectly all right to kill a healthy newborn baby because putting it up for adoption would cause the mother \"stress\" has raised a storm of controversy. The editor of The Journal of Medical Ethics, Julian Savulescu, decried what he called the \"hate speech\" directed at the authors of the article. He also added that the pushback against the article shows that \"proper academic discussion and freedom are under threat from fanatics opposed to the very values of a liberal society.\" (If the values of a \"liberal society\" include murdering newborn babies then count me as a member of the fanatical opposition.) One of the earliest recorded cases of a late term \"after-birth abortion.\" In this case the white parents suffered tremendous \"psychological stress\" when they discovered, much to their chagrin, that their twin sons were \"colored.\" Although there were offers of adoptio"}

The purpose of this often neglected bit of communication is threefold: \u0007 to remind the interviewer(s) how much you really want the job \u0007 to address any issues or gaps that may have arisen during the interview \u0007 to demonstrate that you are willing to go the extra mile, since many job hunters don't bother to send such a note (or send amateurish ones if they do) Every time you go for a job interview , ask each person you meet for their business card . This way you will know their exact names and titles and can send them an appropriate thank you. E-mailed notes are fine. For that extra special touch, consider sending an actual hand written card or note. Here is an example of a typical thank you e-mail: Dear (name of person who interviewed you), Thank you very much for taking the time to interview me on Tuesday afternoon. You gave me quite a bit of insight about your organization and were very courteous and professional. I particularly liked the way you made me feel comfortable from the start. As we discussed, my five years of experience as an Accounts Payable specialist make me an excellent choice for the position we talked about. At one point you asked if I had any additional experience that would be relevant to the job.

The whole band backs SOIA heavily, we also saw one guy piss into another guy's mouth in a Sick Of It All moshpit once but I'm not sure if it was in Europe or the UK. We couldn't stop talking about it for ages after.\" Cancer Bats? - Road Sick \"How much I still mosh at shows depends on how much I've had to drink, if I've had a few beers and if it's a band I really like thenyou might see me in there. I definitely got busy when Slipknot played at Sonisphere, me and the lads got involved in a serious pushpit, we also got onstage with Fred Durst when he called all the girls up. Not sure why. Usually if I resepct a band I always like to go down the front and watch from there, and for some reason I always end up doing an embarrassing stagedive at shows and split my jeans.??\" The Hives - ?Walk Idiot Walk \"I used to love this band as a kid, they had a brutal moshpit in 2003 and the memory of that night stuck with me for so long. I saw them at a festival last year and it didn't live up to my memory of that first show I saw, they are still cool and their music is still incredible, I'm gonna have to go see them again basically!\""}

Tuesday 09 October, 2012 Launched in 2003, Myspace -- one of the founding social media sites, became an instant hit with millions as a way to share photos, music and also as a way to connect with friends. Since then, users of the site have been in decline as Facebook and Twitter have taken the majority of the market share due to trends having shifted to instant updates. The likes of Facebook and Twitter have also embraced comments from their users and as a result, are designed very much with usability in mind. In 2010, Myspace attempted to revitalise itself in an attempt to compete with the other social media giants, launching a new brand and some minor, but much needed updates to the website. The homepage was promising, with bold, unconventional, blocky shapes which stood out from the dull repetitiveness of other social media sites. The only real gripe was the full page images that encase the content. At first glance they look good, but then you realise you're staring at a giant full page advert -- a nod to the difficult times at Myspace HQ. Once you entered however, it was the same old layout (seen so many times before) but not done quite as well. The logo refresh was a nice idea in principle but it always looked a little awkward -- especially with the various versions floating around, some with the word 'space', some without, which showed a lack of confidence in the logo. Overall the rebrand and new site were unsuccessful due to the company failing to roll it out the whole way. Fast-forward to 2012 and another attempt by Myspace to break back into the social media lime light. This time, they appear to have done it properly! The new logo is a much more refined and modernised take on the original, and the overall feel is far more sophisticated and confident. The original logo has been updated with subtle rounded corners, and has been shrunk to fit in line with the text which helps the logo flow much better. The new website is the most drastic change and if it ends up looking like the proposal video, it will position itself far ahead of the likes of Twitter and Facebook in design, by a long way. The focus has been moved towards photos and music, playing to Myspace's strengths, and its new integration with Facebook and Twitter will help the company work alongside them rather than competing directly against them. If this website goes ahead as planned, the Superdream team will for sure be firing up old accounts and jumping back on the Myspace band wagon! How to...

Harry Styles broke the bad news to the U.K.'s The Sun , sharing, \"There is no Justin Bieber on the album.\" The 1D guys and Bieber first sparked rumours of a duet earlier this year when they tweeted about hanging out in the studio together. But 1D denied it to MTV News , with Liam Payne sharing, \"We actually went down to the studio to listen to some of Justin Bieber's tracks. He invited us down and we had a good listen, but there's no real collaboration or anything.\" Even though Bieber won't be on it, the guys have been working with lots of other A-listers on Take Me Home, including British singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran, who also worked with the guys on their debut album, Up All Night . \"I wrote the three tracks that I gave [them]... when I was 17 and they were on my hard drive for a long time,\" Sheeran said. \"And then I gave them one song for their last album, and they came back and said, 'Do you have any more?' and I said, 'Here's a whole load.

Seventeen-year-old Ed just wrote a lot of love songs, so expect to hear a lot of love songs on their album, I guess.\" Ahead of the November 13 album release, the guys will officially drop their single, \"Live While We're Young,\" on October 1.

They said that patients with macular degeneration, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly, would effectively have to lose the use of an eye before qualifying for therapy to save their remaining vision. Their condemnation came as the NHS drug rationing body, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommended restrictions on funding a treatment for the condition. Macular degeneration affects two million people in Britain. One version, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), can mean loss of sight in the affected eye within three to five months of diagnosis. It is the principal cause of irreversible blindness in Britain but the sight of many sufferers can be saved at a cost of around 1,500 per patient if treated early enough. AMD is caused by blood vessels growing under the central part of the retina. When they leak fluid, scar tissue forms and vision can be destroyed. Photodynamic-therapy (PDT) uses laser light to activate a drug, Visudyne, which seals the blood vessels and stops further damage. It is routinely available in most European Union countries and in North America. The treatment has been available in Britain for 18 months at 100 hospitals and 500 patients have been treated. But now NICE's ruling says Visudyne should be used to maintain vision in only one eye in cases of age-related macular degeneration - either the better seeing one or the remaining functioning one where sight has been lost in the other. The AMD Alliance, a group of six charities including the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Macular Disease Society and Age Concern, condemned the decision as 'outrageous'. Steve Winyard, of the Royal National Institute of the Blind, said he was appalled, claiming the decision amounted to saying that it was acceptable for people to go blind in one eye. He estimated that around 1,500 suitable patients would lose out each year. 'This recommendation is outrageous. If upheld, NICE is burdening doctors with the task of telling people that they cannot receive treatment, despite there being an effective therapy available. 'A few people with wet AMD will be able to buy sight in their first eye through private treatment, while those on lower incomes will go blind. 'This wholly unacceptable and needs to be challenged. We know that a number of patient groups plan to appeal this decision and allow more equitable access to this sightsaving therapy.' He argued the costs to society of someone losing their 'Condemned to Russian roulette' sight far outweighed the costs of the treatment. Robin Hill, of the Macular Disease Society, was also disgusted. 'Despite the fact that we have an effective treatment, NICE wants to limit the number of treatments given by the NHS and is recommending that PDT should only be offered to those patients who have already lost the sight of one eye,' he said. 'Patients whose circumstances compel them to rely upon the NHS will be condemned by NICE to Russian roulette for their one good eye. 'An accident or a sudden haemorrhage, or failure to get a clinic appointment within a matter of days, may take away at a stroke life's quality as they know it.' He added that he agreed with critics of NICE who argue that, in many cases, new treatments are being held up simply to save money. There is growing concern that the body, set up to speed up the use of new drugs and treatments, has actually made it more difficult for patients to get care routinely available in other European countries and the U.S. Novartis, the firm which has pioneered Visudyne, said it had no doubt there was ' sufficient evidence' to support the routine use and funding of the treatment on the NHS. There could not be any question over its efficacy and safety, which has been recognised by health authorities around the world, it said. British trials of the treatment, carried out more than two years ago, showed of 600 patients in 22 centres, including Royal Liverpool University Hospital and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, 61 per cent found their condition improved or stabilised."}

It was so great that you wondered whether Berbatov had hauled us to the title single-handedly, and felt a bit sorry for James Collins. When Berbatov arrived, he joined a strikeforce also consisting of Ronaldo, Tevez, and Rooney. The quartet were almost never deployed together, though Ferguson did use them as a 'nuclear option' on occasion -- they were tasked with destroying Tottenham when we found ourselves 2-0 down at White Hart Lane, and the result was the best, most exciting half of football we'd played since the 7-1 versus Roma. Everything gelled that day, and United's fantastic four looked to be in serious contention for the title of 'greatest strikeforce ever put together.' It really did have everything -- physicality, work-rate, irresistible pace, guile, technique, and with all four being able to produce magic and score goals. It turned out to be a false dawn -- Ferguson, in his caution, or wisdom, rarely used all four together, and the last time we saw the combination was in a futile pursuit in the dying stages of the clash with Barcelona in Rome. Berbatov, however, stuck around, and improved in successive seasons but has still not found his place at the club. Having fallen foul of Ferguson's refusal to play him in bigger games, his confidence has wavered, and he has also bizarrely failed to attract the unconditional admiration of the fans enjoyed by the likes of Rooney. It's hard to imagine a player scoring a hat-trick, involving an overhead kick, to defeat Liverpool and attracting such limited reverence. And so, I'm prepared to admit that in a pragmatic light, a move makes a lot of sense. PSG were the club rumoured to be making the bid, and a moneyed club short on success would be ideal, as it would mean we'd get good money for an ageing striker who has never fitted into our system, and has plenty of young replacements waiting in the wings. Yet if we sell Berbatov, we will lose something more valuable -- we will lose our swagger. Berbatov fits into a category of players that has, under Ferguson, included Scholes, Ronaldo, and Cantona -- the player who gets people off their seats. Nani may be capable of the spectacular, but people are reluctant to vacate their sofas when they know that the outcome is more likely to be a shot wildly blazed into the stands. Berbatov, like the other players named, not only has the capacity for magic, but there's also the very high probability that when the ball is moved on, we'll be in a better position than we were previously. Yes, contrary to the doubters' views, Berbatov is reliable. Rooney would be our spark if he could be trusted not to give the ball away with a leaden touch or a floated, searching pass to the linesman. And it's the unpredictability we'll miss -- ways of scoring goals we hadn't thought of, rather than a small repertoire of simple goals which can at times find itself quickly exhausted Still, Ferguson's European record in recent years makes it difficult to question his judgement. Berbatov was unlikely to have been key to either Champions League defeat to Barcelona, and perhaps his style of play really is at odds with the modern game -- too slow to put pressure on an opposition backline, not energetic enough to close down midfielders. Instead Rooney has been moved to this role, a player with half of Berbatov's imagination and reliability with the ball but who never neglects his defensive duties. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the closest player to Berbatov around in terms of style, fell out of favour at Barcelona for similar reasons, and success has eluded him at the highest level in Europe. So perhaps there isn't room for imagination anymore. Sheer imagination is no longer for settling tight games between giants, but for unlocking the massed defences of Birmingham and Stoke. The genius who would formerly be the inspirational, talismanic presence is now a squad player to be used in a specific situation. It's happening elsewhere too -- Ronaldo and Messi have been more effective as they have become more flairless, and Barcelona, the greatest team of our age, have a passing game not modelled on the swagger and fearlessness of the great Brazilian sides, or the patience supported by magic of Italian masters, but rather the robotic uniformity we label as boring when practised by Germans. It's a painful thought, but if Berbatov wants to be back playing his best football, playing the best role he can for a team, then he should leave. There are plenty of clubs that would be ideal for him, but sadly, United, and anyone else with notions of European dominance, are not one of them. It'll be sad to see him go, and the memories will remain, but Dimitar -- I just want what's best for you. Great article Callum. It must be painful to write some home truths about "}

That means that our fears don't get put into words, everything has to be ciphered and cryptic, but we absolutely must express our fear in some way, so we can't stay totally silent.

But it is not our safety we have to be mindful of, our words here could impact another person's life. Perhaps there is nothing we can say about the circumstances at all without it being too much. What we can say, though, is that there is something we have been very worried about for weeks, and it is very serious but we have been able to contain the panic. However, tonight (it's 4am) we cannot sleep, and have finally begun to experience the uncontrolled sense of helplessness and terror that accompanies this scary situation.

Look for a platypus on the Branxholm Community River Walk, north east Tassie Hobbyts Dragon craft shop in Derby, in the Tasmanian north east region Fish Rock on the outskirts of the Tasmanian north east township of Derby To Mt Paris Dam; then a Beer at Weldborough Drive a little further afield, and Shirley could be standing at the base of the Mt Paris Dam , an engineering marvel. If she likes beer, she'd be certain to stop at the nearby Weldborough Hotel and have a chat with Mark and Felicity over a few micro-brews. Mt Paris Dam, a feat of engineering for the tin mining industry, north east Tasmania In fact, while driving around, there's lots of scenery and attractions to admire. We stopped briefly at the tiny township of Legerwood , to wonder at the memorial carvings on our way to Ralphs Falls and Pyengana Dairy . The rural scenery is simply breathtaking, with a magical vista in every direction. In the Blue Tiers, we inspected the site of the Anchor Tin Mine, and the relics of the historic stamper. But this is definitely one place that warrants more time to explore.  If you have a mountain or trail bike, or enjoy bush-walking and camping, the Blue Tier Forest Reserve would make the perfect holiday destination . The Forest EcoCentre in Scottsdale is a good place to collect information about the surrounding forests. Relics from the Anchor Tin Mine in the Tasmanian north east Blue Tier Forest Reserve We'd love to return to the Tasmanian north east region and forage for food.  Not out in the forest, but at places like Bridestowe Lavender and Yondover Goat Dairy. There's local markets and wineries and food producers offering gourmet travellers a unique experience in beautiful surrounds.  Of course, Shirley might prefer to have someone else cook her meals on a weekend escape , and there's any number of places to choose for a good feed. Hot and hearty: the food at the Weldborough Hotel was thoroughly enjoyable With Any Luck, We'll be Back As you can see, we've covered lots of ground already, but there's still lots more we could investigate in the future, given the opportunity.  We're excited for Shirley and very happy to have been involved with this giveaway for Tin Dragon Trail Cottages. Graham and Christine are definitely keen for people to appreciate what their region has to offer.  Judging by all the entries and feedback the competition received, many other people will be out exploring the Tasmanian north east as well as the winner.

It's a sensational property and Graham and Christine are lovely hosts. As you've suggested, there's heaps to do both on the property and in the area. We're so glad we read your earlier article on Branxholm and Tin Dragon Trail Cottages and their competition which was what started us on this latest mini holiday. So... a big \"THANK YOU\" to Think Tasmania. On the property we really enjoyed our spa under the stars (or ... on the night when it was raining ... under the huge umbrella .... no stars seeing there were clouds anyway). The cottages here are really tastefully designed and built and everything is thought of ... from Glad Wrap to fresh flowers, generous breakfast provisions to availability of BBQ and picnic packs for pre-ordering. Wallabies and echidnas and alpacas are all here ... despite us spending some time sitting by the river, the platypus was shy, so we hope to meet him on a second visit. By the time we had visited the cheese factory and Pyengana , walked down to the base of Colomba falls (and back up), visited Branxholm (stunning vistas here over the rows of little lavender shrubs even though the lavender isn't in bloom till December) "}

There's heaps of cenotes along this road, but we stopped at this one on the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel. We didn't come here as part of a tour - we had a hire car and were doing our own thing for the day. We visited a different cenote the previous week (Hubiku Cenote) which was so different I just can't begin to explain. Gran Cenote was just unbelievably beautiful - words just fail me. You park up at this nondescript location, walk down a set of wooden stairs into a wonderland. The water is so clear! Little turtles and brightly coloured fish swim around you, if you're not careful you bump your snorkel top into ancient stalactites, you can see the white sand at the bottom of the cave....well, the part of the cenote before it drops off into the underwater cave system. With the snorkels and masks we swam around and watched the divers go into the caves, and then return - their lights illuminated the deeper underwater areas beautifully. Almost made me want to learn to scuba! Entrance is 100 pesos per person, snorkel hire (including flippers and life vest if you want one) is 70 pesos for as long as you want. There was a cafe on site but it wasn't open when we visited. There was space to have a picnic if you wanted one. Toilets were fairly clean.

What a great visit!\" Reviewed 7 November 2012 We took the ADO bus to Gran Cenote from Tulum-cost about 36 pesos for both of us--Very comfortable air-conditioned tour bus. You can get a round trip ticket-but we did not. We ended up taking a taxi back to Tulum and it cost about 100 pesos. Definitely should have gotten the round trip ticket. Arrived early afternoon. It costs 10 pesos each to get in. Bring your own breather thingy!--but they do have life jackets; breather thingys and masks for rent. I bought my mask and tube at the local grocery store for about $100 pesos- i believe. The water was wonderful; the views were awesome. The snorkling was great. It was not too crowded when we arrived, but it did get a little crowded later. Need to be careful about running into other snorklers. There were also scuba divers there as well. It was neat to be snorkling on top of the water and look at the scuba divers so far below with their lights. I was able to see alot of rock formations b/c I was tagging along with the divers who were using lights. It was very easy to get into the water-there were various entrances. The under water caverns were a sight to behold. I can imagine during the high season that this place would be packed and might not be so enjoyable. They have t-shirts for sale and a little cafeteria-we tried the food. I had some chicken flautas--not enough chicken in them and husband had a ham and cheese torta-he liked it--very cheap food.

This machine is more capable at finding prostate cancer than any other type of scan - in both bones and soft tissue. Only currently available for public treatment from one place in the world. It is not likely to ever be found in your local neighbourhood clinic because it requires a cyclotron on site. It may, however, in future be found in larger centres in major hospitals. I am told that a hospital in Liverpool NSW is getting a cyclotron, but I do not know if that is true, or if they will be using it for this. Technical explanation - skip to the video link below if you aren't interested in the technology. (Jim Marshall is also not a physicist.) This cyclotron shoots beams of tiny particles at high speed. So did your old cathode-ray tube TV, at a much lower speed. The beams hit the screen and lit the dots up. So did your linear accelerator (if you had radiation), at much higher speeds than the TV. The beams hit the DNA in your cells and damaged it. Your cancer cells can't repair themselves as well as healthy cells. The cyclotron is much more powerful than either of these. It pokes tiny particles into atoms, where they stay temporarily, and then later fly out. In the process here, the cyclotron particle beam is aimed at Carbon, which then temporarily to turns into a radioactive form called Carbon 11 (C11). Radioactive C11 is attached to Choline, a naturally occurring substance from your body, and injected. Choline likes your prostate cancer cells better than other cells, and stays around the prostate cancer cells. The attached radioactive C11 sends out, or emits, small particles called positrons as it goes back to being non-radioactive carbon. A machine called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner can see these positrons flying out. The PET scanner makes a picture for your doctor - in this case with the active prostrate cancer cells brighter than others - as you can clearly see in the video in the link below. Because it can only see active prostate cancer cells it is of no use while hormone treatment or other drugs are holding you in remission - your PSA has to be rising. The cyclotron has to be on site because C11 loses its radioactivity very quickly - half the radioactivity is lost in 20 minutes. This scan looks like it could replace all others in searching for active prostate cancer where it can be made available."}

Those are the questions everyone wants an answer to and I'm going to attempt to do just that. Digitimes recently reported that suppliers will be shipping 4 million touch (OGS) panels for the Nexus 7 in Q3 2012. Based on this, and some other data we already have, we can make an educated estimate of the Nexus 7's sales volume. Q3 2011 Production & Sales Production Volume From the Digitimes report above, TPK Holding & Wintek are the suppliers for the Nexus 7's OGS panels. The two companies shipped one million units in June and 1.4 million units in July. Including the 1.4 million units in July, they have received orders for 4 million panels in Q3 2012. These figures should be equal to the number of Nexus 7 units going into production in each of those months/quarters. We also know that the initial shipment volume delivered to Google was 600,000 units in June . We also know that Google had initially estimated sales of 3 million units by the end of the year . This means that after looking at initial demand, Google & Asus may have roughly doubled their estimates and cranked up the production volume. Using these figures with Little's Law gives us a cycle time of 2.5 weeks, i.e. it takes 2.5 weeks to produce and deliver a Nexus 7 unit to Google. Since monthly production volume stays at roughly 1-1.5 million units, production capacity is unlikely to be a constraint. Therefore, we can assume a constant cycle time and calculate the total Nexus 7 orders delivered to Google at the end of each month. Sales Estimate Once we have the Nexus 7 units available with Google, all we need to do is calculate the initial \"sell-through rate\" to get an estimate Nexus 7 sales so far. The Nexus 7 went up for sale in mid-July and the 16GB units were sold out in a week and we heard initial reports of sell outs of the 8GB version in 3 weeks . Since we know the size of the first production batch was one million units, it is a reasonable estimate for sales volume at that time to be the same. Also, since we know that Google had ordered more 8GB units (as compared to 16GB units) the \"sell-through rate\" would be about 2-3 weeks. In order to normalize the sell-through rate for demand fluctuations throughout the year, we can assume a conservative sell-through rate of 4 weeks throughout the forecast period, i.e. any batch of Nexus 7 units delivered to Google take about 4 weeks to be sold (either online or to stores). Based on this, we can derive the following sales estimate for Q3 2012: Based on the 4 million units produced, we can estimate a sales volume of approximately 3 million units in Q3 2012. This was approximately the same as Google's original estimate for sales in H2 2012 (Jul-Dec). Q4 2012 Production & Sales Now, Q4 is where this gets a little more challenging. The original report from Digitimes states that monthly shipments of OGS panels are expected to drop to 0.1-0.4 million units because of increased competition from the iPad Mini and the new Kindle Fire. It is a little unclear if this is the shipment per supplier or the total number of shipments. In any case, such a production drop is extremely unlikely as there is tremendous market demand for high quality tablets at that price point. While the competition will have an impact on market share, rapid market expansion will ensure healthy Quarter-on-Quarter (QoQ) shipment growth for major devices. In addition to this, Q4 is usually a period where demand surges because of holiday sales. In order to set a benchmark, let's take a look at the impact of the last two high profile tablet launches on the QoQ shipment volume growth of their competitors. As we can clearly see from the chart above, major tablet launches have had no adverse impact on the sales growth of competing tablets. Based on this data, 35-40% seems to be a reasonable estimate of QoQ shipment growth of the Nexus 7 in Q4 2012. However, the fact that we have two major tablet launches coming in Q4 (New Kindle Fire & iPad Mini) could cause a greater negative impact than seen previously. Therefore, it may be a better idea to consider a larger range of production volumes. Taking a 35% QoQ sales growth as a mean estimate, with the limiting condition that sales are unlikely to fall from Q3 to Q4, we get a sales estimate of about 3-5 million units in Q4 2012. This takes the total sales estimate in 2012 to 6-8 million units. These numbers would be a huge boost to Android tablets in their market share battle with the iPad and, in combination with the new Kindle Fire, would put them well on track to meet my mid-2013 market share expectation . Conclusion - Based on these data points, the estimate for the current sales volume of the Nexus 7 is over one million units. In total, we ca"}

This task involves understanding how they understand us, or misunderstand us. The The umbrella issue that separates us, under which the other issues stand, is the nature and authority of the Church, for all the things that Catholics believe in that Protestants don?t (e.g., the seven sacraments, transubstantiation, praying to saints, Mary?s Immaculate Conception and Assumption, papal infallibility), Catholics believe in because of the teaching authority of the Church. What is the Church, as taught in Scripture, and what is the basis of our disagreement with Protestants over its nature? I was a Protestant (Dutch Reformed) for the first twenty-one years of my life. Becoming a Catholic was one of the two best things I ever did ? that, and marrying the greatest woman in the world. Yet, I have never lost my respect and affection for the faith of my Protestant friends. This part of the book is designed to help Catholics understand the most serious Protestant objections to Catholicism and to answer them. Such a task is necessary, not optional. We have entered upon a new age of ecumenism. Battle lines are being radically clarified and redrawn. It is finally becoming clear (almost everywhere except in Northern Ireland, it seems) to both ?sides? that we have misidentified our real enemies; that an orthodox Catholic and an orthodox Protestant have far more in common than either has with a Modernist in his own church. For the questions that divide Protestants from Catholics, like whether popes are infallible, are obviously less important than the questions that divide orthodox Christians from Modernists, like whether Christ really rose from the dead. If popes are not infallible, then our certainty about dogma may be in trouble, but ?if Christ is not risen from the dead, your faith is vain and you are still in your sins.? More misunderstanding and hostility have been overcome in the last thirty years than in the previous three hundred, in large part because of Vatican 11 and the last four popes, all of whom have placed dialogue with Protestants high on their agenda. In fact, John Paul II announced that one of the three priority items for his pontificate was reunion, first with Eastern Orthodoxy. (The other two were cleaning up the church in America and preventing nuclear war.) Healing the schism of 1054 with Eastern Orthodoxy involves overcoming far fewer obstacles than healing the division of the Protestant Reformation, of course. Yet we may not abandon even that harder hope, for it is clearly our Lord?s will that we be ?one flock, with one shepherd?. Our divisions are not necessary, not in the nature of things. They all began in history, and they can end in history. One thing we can do to help is to understand our Protestant ?separated brethren?. This task involves understanding how they understand us, or misunderstand us. That is our topic here. The umbrella issue that separates us, under which the other issues stand, is the nature and authority of the Church, for all the things that Catholics believe in that Protestants don?t (e.g., the seven sacraments, transubstantiation, praying to saints, Mary?s Immaculate Conception and Assumption, papal infallibility), Catholics believe in because of the teaching authority of the Church. What is the Church? As Pope John XXIII put it, she is our mater et magistra (mother and teacher), but she is our mother before she is our teacher. We are born into a spiritual family, not by physical birth but by faith and baptism. This spiritual family has various names. The three most important ones are (1) the Church, ek-klesia, literally the called-out ones, those who are called by God out of the world to be part of his new world, new kingdom; (2) the mystical body of Christ, Christ?s own hands and feet; (3) the people of God, the family of God. How do Protestants understand the Church? Because everything I have just said about the Church is clearly taught in Scripture and because orthodox Protestants believe everything in Scripture, they believe all these things. Where, then, is the disagreement? For one thing, it is a difference in emphasis. Protestants are more individualistic than Catholics. They tend to think that individuals are saved first and then join a sort of society of the saved. Catholics think, rather, that being saved is to be put into the Church, as Noah?s family was saved by being put into the ark. (The Fathers of the Church often used Noah?s ark as a symbol for the Church, by the way. When you compare the variety of creatures in both vessels, the comparison seems apt). But Protestants too have to admit that the Church is not just a human social club but of divine origin because Scripture clearly teaches this. Where, then, do they differ with us? Their criticism is usually that Catholics ignore the need to make an individual, personal deci"}

Introduction The usual explanation relates to a variable raised to the power of something. For example, 10 to the power of 2 is 100 (10 2 = 10 * 10 = 100). The 2 in this case in the exponent, hence the word exponential. Exponential functions of the nature F(x) = x n produce the classic exponential curve when plotted on a graph. \"Most people have an intuitive understanding of what it means to have exponential growth . Basically, it means that things are increasing in an out-of-control way, like a virus in a horror movie.\" This is the sort of growth that, it is generally inferred, far surpasses any other kind of growth. Is it a necessary condition, however, that the growth rate must be constant? From the endnotes for Chapter 1 of \"The Population Explosion\" (Ehrlich, 1990): \" Exponential growth occurs when the increase in population size in a given period is a constant percentage of the size at the beginning of the period. Thus a population growing at 2 percent annually or a bank account growing at 6 percent annually will be growing exponentially. \" In this article I will be challenging the assumption that exponential growth requires a constant rate. Powers Of 2 Taking \"powers of 2\" as our example, here's what happens when 1 A-Pop keeps on doubling: From 1 to 1,073,741,824 - it's pretty explosive growth, isn't it? The problem with this view is that, from a real-world perspective, the growth occurs outside of time . How long did it take to get from 1 A-Pop to 1,024 C-Pops? Without factoring in time, such representations of exponential growth have no real-world value. The solution is simple - add a constant doubling period and it's easy to calculate. If the doubling period is 25 years, each row represents 250 years of growth. Hence, 3 rows worth of growth equals 750 years of growth. This is classical exponential growth. Given that it took 750 years in this case, would you call that explosive growth? The Rule Of 70 Using the Rule Of 70 , it is commonly accepted that a population that grows at 1% will double every 70 years (approx) whereas a population that grows at 2% will double every 35 years (approx). Giving each population 700 years to grow, it would look like this: Doubling Period 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Doubling Period 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 35 B-Pops 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 3 - Population Doubles Every 35 years for 700 years. It's exponential growth, but is this explosive growth? The following example is even slower. Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops, 1B-pop = 1024 A-pops Doubling Period 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 70 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Table 4 - Population Doubles Every 70 years for 700 years Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops, 1B-pop = 1024 A-pops Exponential Growth But Not Always Explosive Growth Clearly, the smaller the constant rate, the less \"explosive\" exponential growth becomes. Perhaps it's worth quoting Darwin at this point (Darwin, 1859, from the chapter The Struggle For Existence): \"There is no exception to the rule that every organic being increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair.\" So, the point to remember about the popular perception of \"explosive\" out-of-control exponential growth is that all species of living creatures are capable of it. However, where the constant growth rate is kept close to zero, it should be no surprise that exponential growth can produce the illusion of almost stable growth. For example, a human population growing exponentially at 0.1%  would take approximately 700 years to double . Hardly explosive growth in human terms! However, even this humble growth rate is theoretically capable of producing a population that outweighs the Earth itself, in time. This is, in fact, a major argument against the \"simple exponential\" growth model (Kelly, 2002): \"Truth be told, there are not a lot of natural cases in which exponential growth is exhibited. An exponential growth model assumes that there is an infinite amount of resources from which to draw.\" So Does Exponential Growth Require A Constant Rate Of Growth? However, the interest rate supposedly needs to remain constant for the growth to be classified as exponential. Really? Try these examples: Doubling Period 35 35 35 35 35 70 70 70 70 70 A-Pops (billions) 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Exponential growth for 175 years Exponential growth for 350 years Exponential growth? Table 5 - Population doubles at a constant rate of 2% for 175 years, and then  grows at a constant rate of 1% for the next 350 years. Note:  1A-pop = 1024 pops So, if we describe the growth from 1 to 32 billion it can be said to be exponential. If we examine the growth from 64 to 1024 billion it can also be said to be exponential. What about the overall growth from 1 to 1,024 billion? What single word in the English language describes such growth? Why not exponential? If"}

Mainstream psychiatry and psychology has been thoroughly compromised by homosexual activists and sympathizing ideologues. \"Homosexuality\" was removed from the DSM list of disorders in 1973 as a result of to homosexual activist coercion, bullying, threats in 1973, and not based on any scientifically objective decisions. At the 1978 annual APA (American Psychiatric Association) meeting, a formal structure was adopted for the Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Caucus of the American Psychiatric Association, which is now named the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists (AGLP). In 1978, an official APA Task Force on Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Issues was established, which was given formal status as a standing committee in 1981. The following year the Assembly, APA's legislative branch, approved adding elected representatives from a group initially designated as the Caucus of Homosexually Identified Psychiatrists, and later renamed the Caucus of Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual psychiatrists. The Caucus is still active in the APA Assembly. Since its founding, AGLP with a membership of over 600 psychiatrists, has been active in helping to shape the dramatic conceptual shift in the cultural understanding and significance of homosexual behavior within psychiatry and within society.

GamersFirst: \"Scotland would be a fine place to have a permanent office\" Free to play MMO firm GamersFirst, the new owner of notorious MMO APB, is considering opening an office in the UK when the time comes to found a European HQ. When questioned by GamesIndustry.biz on the possibility of employing or contracting former Realtime Worlds staff members, CCO and CTO Bjorn Book-Larsson stated that \"We are open to talking to everyone who was associated with the original game,\" though acknowledged that many staff had scattered to other firms. In the event that a number of ex-staff were contracted and the relaunched game proved successful, it was possible that a Scottish office could be opened. \"Absolutely. Basically, the one thing we don't have at the moment is a European office, which is something we've been looking at. \"We have looked at Hamburg in Germany, but what we're looking at now potentially is.... Well, Scotland would certainly be a fine place to have a permanent office. We'd consider that for sure.\" Government incentives - or the lack thereof - would not be a deciding factor in this decision, Book-Larsson suggested. \"It would be more about being a strategic location for us than anything else. \"Which is why Germany could also be a good one... I'm not sure that we're aware of what the various incentives are, so we haven't considered those.\" While GamersFirst has not revealed the sum paid for APB (to be relaunched in the first half of 2011 as APB: Reloaded), Book-Larsson did reveal that the game had other suitors. \"There were several interested parties for sure. We happened to run into some of them too... So we know who they were. \"It wasn't really a bidding war, I wouldn't say, but it was pretty clear that in order to be competitive you probably had to consider this as something you were going to invest quite a lot of effort into. And I think some people are probably more opportunistic in wanting to only pick up a piece or two.\" For the full interview with Bjorn Book-Larsson, in which he also discusses how straightforward it will be to convert APB to free to play and why the company is happy to not make money on the game during its first year, please click here .

PIMCO's Bill Gross: 'The Age of Inflation Is Upon Us' Credit lenders are frugal, will not indulge 'obese' borrowers In typical Bill Gross style, the head of the world's largest bond shop employs the Lindy dance craze, former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince, the Wimpy cartoon character and his dying cult of equity argument in a mash-up of prose to describe the \"age of inflation that is upon us,\" which he claims typically \"provides a headwind, not a tailwind, to securities prices in both stocks and bonds.\" In his monthly outlook for September he begins, as usual, with a bit of history. \"Credit, of course, is what makes the global economy go ...Wimpy said it best, 'I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,'\" Gross writes. \"So McDonald's grew from a million to 500 billion served and Wimpy and his wimpalikes were delighted in the exchange, although their arteries and midsections inevitably came out a loser ... But in order to promote and indeed foster continuing symbiosis, both borrower and lender need to operate in a nutrient-rich environment, a \"credit\" petri dish of sorts which fosters strong bones and healthy lenders and borrowers in their adult years. That unfortunately does not seem to be the case. Wimpy's weight-challenged midsection, he continues, is an \"obvious testament to the overleveraged condition of today's global borrowers. Too much debt leads to forced diets and de-levering, a process which has been ongoing since Lehman 2008. Borrowers are just not in a healthy place and if history is our guide, their restoration may be almost biblical in terms of timing: seven years of fat followed by seven years of lean -- perhaps even longer.\" Gross adds lenders will not easily lend money to an obese over-indebted borrower, but will also not extend a check when the yield, carry and return on investment is so low that it cannot compensate for historic business model overheads. When yields are too low, and acceptable risk spreads so narrow that top-line interest revenue is increasingly marginalized, then lending is at risk. \"Last month's 'dying cult of equity' Investment Outlook elicited a lot of excitement, but somehow failed to impress readers with its main point: Returns from both stocks and bonds will be stunted. How could one argue otherwise on the bond side with investment grade bonds yielding only 1.75%? How could one argue otherwise for stocks under the assumption that bond and stock returns were at least in part mathematically conjoined at the hip? How could one argue otherwise when it is obvious that boomers and Xers, Ys and Zers are likely to be disenchanted for their own good reasons for years?\" If he were an individual investor, Gross adds, he would do this: \"Balance your asset mix according to your age. Own more stocks if you are young, but more bonds if you are in your 60s, like myself. If you choose an investment advisor, a mutual fund, or an ETF, make sure that your fees are minimized. After all, if overall returns average 3% to 4% annually, how can you possibly afford to give 100 basis points of it back? You cannot. And be careful. The age of credit expansion which led to double-digit portfolio returns is over. The age of inflation is upon us, which typically provides a headwind, not a tailwind, to securities price -- both stocks and bonds.\""}

This section describes these models and how to extend them to create your own custom content for a Mezzanine site. The foundation of a Mezzanine site is the model mezzanine.pages.models.Page . Each Page instance is stored in a hierarchical tree to form the site's navigation, and an interface for managing the structure of the navigation tree is provided in the admin via mezzanine.pages.admin.PageAdmin . All types of content inherit from the Page model and Mezzanine provides a default content type via the mezzanine.pages.models.RichTextPage model which simply contains a WYSIWYG editable field for managing HTML content. In order to handle different types of pages that require more structured content than provided by the RichTextPage model, you can simply create your own models that inherit from Page . For example if we wanted to have pages that were authors with books: from django.db import models from mezzanine.pages.models import Page # The members of Page will be inherited by the Author model, such # as title, slug, etc. For authors we can use the title field to # store the author's name. For our model definition, we just add # any extra fields that aren't part of the Page model, in this # case, date of birth. class Author ( Page ): dob = models . DateField ( \"Date of birth\" ) class Book ( models . Model ): author = models . ForeignKey ( \"Author\" ) cover = models . ImageField ( upload_to = \"authors\" ) Next you'll need to register your model with Django's admin to make it available as a content type. If your content type only exposes some new fields that you'd like to make editable in the admin, you can simply register your model using the mezzanine.pages.admin.PageAdmin class: Any regular model fields on your content type will be available when adding or changing an instance of it in the admin. This is similar to Django's behaviour when registering models in the admin without using an admin class, or when using an admin class without fieldsets defined. In these cases all the fields on the model are available in the admin. If however you need to customize your admin class, you can inherit from PageAdmin and implement your own admin class. The only difference is that you'll need to take a copy of PageAdmin.fieldsets and modify it if you want to implement your own fieldsets, otherwise you'll lose the fields that the Page model implements: When registering content type models with PageAdmin or subclasses of it, the admin class won't be listed in the admin index page, instead being made available as a type of Page when creating new pages from the navigation tree. Note When creating custom content types, you must inherit directly from the Page model. Further levels of subclassing are currently not supported. Therefore you cannot subclass the RichTextPage or any other custom content types you create yourself. Should you need to implement a WYSIWYG editable field in the way the RichTextPage model does, you can simply subclass both Page and RichText , the latter being imported from mezzanine.core.models . When creating models that inherit from the Page model, multi-table inheritance is used under the hood. This means that when dealing with the page object, an attribute is created from the subclass model's name. So given a Page instance using the previous example, accessing the Author instance would be as follows: The view function mezzanine.pages.views.page handles returning a Page instance to a template. By default the template pages/page.html is used, but if a custom template exists it will be used instead. The check for a custom template will first check for a template with the same name as the Page instance's slug, and if not then a template with a name derived from the subclass model's name is checked for. So given the above example the templates pages/dr-seuss.html and pages/author.html would be checked for respectively. The view function futher looks through the parent hierarchy of the Page . If a Page instance with slug authors/dr-suess is a child of the Page with slug authors , the templates pages/authors/dr-seuss.html , pages/authors/dr-seuss/author.html , pages/authors/author.html , pages/author.html , and pages/pages.html would be checked for respectively. This lets you specify a template for all children of a Page and a different template for the Page itself. For example, if an additional author were added as a child page of authors/dr-suess with the slug authors/dr-seuss/theo-lesieg , the template pages/authors/dr-seuss/author.html would be among those checked. A typical problem that reusable Django apps face, is being able to extend the app's templates rather than overriding them. The app will usually provide templates that the app will look for by name, which allows the developer to create their own versions of the templates in their project's templates directory. However if the templ"}

Sundries AOC Book Club: Jimmy: My Story In James Anderson's autobiography, Jimmy: My Story , England's attack leader makes some startling revelations about the truth of that disastrous tour Down Under in 2006/07. In the following extract, he reveals the boozy culture that developed amongst the players that ultimately led to Andrew Flintoff's infamous 'Fredalo' incident at the World Cup in the Caribbean. A Sobering Winter There is one night of shame that will be indelibly linked with the winter of 2006/07. It has been referred to ever since simply as the pedalo night. The night that ended with Andrew Flintoff knee-deep in the Caribbean Sea at around 2am, and he and a number of other members of our World Cup squad, including yours truly, in altogether hotter water. However, this excessive night on the beer wasn't spontaneous and isolated. It had been, excuse the expression, brewing for months. There weren't many England tourists that winter who could paint a saintly picture of themselves when it came to the consumption of alcohol in Australia. When you consider that we were an international sports team, it is shocking to consider what went on during that Ashes trip. Undoubtedly, some of our guys turned to booze as a direct consequence of what was happening to us on the field against one of the best international teams in history. Things hit new lows for a lot of our Ashes squad that winter, we weren't enjoying the tour either individually or collectively, and we were being comprehensively outplayed by a side intent on putting their name in international cricket folklore. We were getting abused by crowds to an Olympic standard -- in volume at least, both noise and amount, if not content: 'What do you call an Englishman with a hundred next to his name? A bowler' is a slow burner I grant you and one day soon it might raise a laugh. While their punters got zero marks for originality, however, we got a similar score for our efforts. Goodness knows what level of stick we were getting back home -- thankfully we have an out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach to British headlines and news bulletins when on the other side of the world. But we got the gist of disappointment resonating around the country because we felt it ourselves as we lurched from defeat to defeat. And we sought solace in the bottom of pint glasses. Our first beer was usually in what the Australians call their rooms -- never been sure why they use the plural as they only ever showed us one, and it was the one they got changed in -- after matches. Having a drink post-match with the opposition became a feature of the 2005 Ashes and so we upheld the Australian practice of displaying grace in defeat throughout the series, although being there among them became increasingly annoying with each pasting. To be fair, the Australians displayed great levels of humility throughout that Test series, except that is for Michael Clarke , in the aftermath of Adelaide, where we prised defeat from the gums of a well-chewed draw. While others chatted with opposite numbers about the game, Clarke was being a complete pain, whistling away to himself and carrying on in a most arrogant manner. He and I are very much contemporaries. Having first met on a night out in Blackburn in the late 1990s when he was an overseas player in the Lancashire League, we then made our international debuts within the space of a month during the VB Triangular Series in 2002/03. And his aloof behaviour on this occasion seriously pissed me off. I said as much to Damien Martyn, who I was sat chatting to at the time, and, looking down at my feet, added: 'See this pad here, I really want to wrap it around his head.' 'Do it,' Martyn replied, completely straight-faced. Now while Martyn was notorious for being someone who did not mix particularly well with his own teammates, and was not close to anyone, preferring to be something of a lone wolf, his bullish attitude nevertheless took me aback. I looked at him again as if to ask: 'Are you sure?' 'Do it!' he repeated. As I'd had a couple of beers, I didn't need a second invitation, so I picked this pad up and cuffed Clarke with it, making the biggest thud imaginable in the process, and causing everyone in the room to stop nattering. For a split second there was complete silence. 'What the f**k ya doing?' he snarled. Naturally, the temperature in the room had risen and the sensible thing to do was to cool it by cutting the night short and leaving. For once that winter, we did the sensible thing. It was not an episode I look back on with any pride but the theme of drowning our sorrows and seeking solace in beer was extended throughout the rest of the trip. It is fair to say that I was lacking direction both on and off the "}

(As our editor Matt Holmes turns 25 today, he's out of office and we are going to re-publish some old favourites.) With the frustrating news breaking last week that Guillermo Del Toro's adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness (based on an H.P. Lovecraft story) is 'dead', I began thinking about some of the other potentially great projects that audiences were tragically destined to never see. From further research it's clear that the major directors that have worked within the industry have abandoned vast numbers of productions that would have easily been big money makers and both critical and financial successes. Indeed, filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch and Orson Welles have abandoned dozens of projects, even after beginning production on some of them! Read on to discover the ten unrealised features that we'd love to have seen completed... 10. GEORGE SLUIZER'S DARK BLOOD George Sluizer's Dark Blood starred River Phoenix as Boy, a widower who lives as a hermit on a nuclear testing site. In this tale of a dystopian future, Boy waits for the end of the world while making dolls he believes have magical powers. Boy ends up helping a couple (Jonathan Pryce and Judy Davis) when their car breaks down whilst travelling through the desert. Only 11 days short of completion, the production was shut down by the tragic death of Phoenix outside the Viper Room in LA from a drug overdose. Angry at the loss of expenses through the abandonment of the production, Phoenix's grieving mother was sued by the films producers for $6 million to compensate for this, claiming that the actor had not declared his drug use! Needless to say, the case eventually collapsed. What finished portions of the film remain in existence are still entirely owned by director George Sluizer. Whilst he will never complete the film for general release now that Phoenix is gone, he has suggested that he intends to use it as footage in a documentary about the actor's life. Some really raw footage on YouTube remains the only scenes released to the public to this day... 09. JERRY LEWIS' THE DAY THE CLOWN CRIED Jerry Lewis , known predominantly for his comedy films and cabaret acts with partner Dean Martin, was also fond of directing. Behind the camera of some of his most successful work (including The Bellboy [1960] and The Nutty Professor [1963]) his unique gift for comedy proved an excellent skill when it came to directing. However, how he thought he could turn a film about a clown hired to entertain children as they are sent into a darkly humorous comment on society is beyond me. Whilst it was intended to be a piece of comic pathos on one of humanity's darkest hours, it simply screamed of bad taste. Lewis began production believing that he was creating something worthwhile on the horrors of the Holocaust, however it soon became apparent that his changes to the script (in an attempt to make the clown character he played more sympathetic) meant the film left a bitter taste in any viewer's mouth. As well as narrative set backs, production was hindered by a lack of money supplied by producer Nathan Waschberger (who eventually ran out of money before production completed), the damage and late delivery of equipment and the major problem that Waschberger's option for the screenplay had expired before shooting began (he apparently paid an initial $5000 fee to authors Joan O'Brien and Charles Denton, but failed to send a further $50000 that was due before production began). Filming was all but complete when production was shut down due to the lack of financing and it is reported that Lewis owns the only videotaped copy of the film in existence (the whereabouts of the original negative is unknown). In his autobiography Jerry Lewis in Person, the director claims that he will release a version of the film for public viewing if he can return to Sweden for some final pick-up shots. However, the likelihood of this happening is very slight and Lewis refuses to comment on the film in any interviews. Whether or not this is a bad thing remains debatable! If, however, you have a pressing urge to view the film it seems the only way of doing so is by getting yourself invited to one of the exclusive screenings put on by long time Hollywood insiders. However, if it's highly unlikely that you'll find yourself invited to such an event I'm afraid you'll have to class this as one of those films that you simply weren't meant to see... 08. ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S THE SHORT NIGHT After a rather insipid citical and viewer response to Family Plot (1976), Alfred Hitchcock intended to return to his comfort zone for what he intended to be his last film. This project was based on the novel The Short Night , a spy thriller by Ronald Kirkbride . A British double agent manages to escape from prison and flees to Moscow, where his wife and children are await him. An American agent plots to intercept him but falls in love with the double agent"}

About anything.\" The dog's first sentence in the book is: \"Need a poo, Todd.\" Want to know more? Read the book , The Knife of Never Letting Go , by Patrick Ness. I found the book, a deeply philosophical action-packed science fiction thriller, excellent, in a nail-biting sort of way, and think it would be a popular addition to secondary libraries. This year's Newbery Award winning book existed for many years as a first sentence only. To quote the author: I had a notebook with the words, \"There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife.\" That was definitely going to be the first line. I had begun and given up on the opening many times, and suddenly I thought, I can start in the middle. So I did. So what do you think makes a great first sentence in a book? Maybe you could hold a competition with students and teachers putting forward their favourites. Perhaps your students could devise their own great first sentences.

The real issue here is that Beth Brody and Brody PR completely missed an opportunity to throw herself into the conversation. This didn't have to go nuclear -- one of the most common comments is reflected in Jennifer Leggio's opening, \"I try to be supportive of the public relations industry.\" I guarantee you that if Ms. Brody, or one of her staff, were to jump in and beg forgiveness and really address all of the issues of each \"reply all\" recipient, then this would not have ended up in ZDNet and AdAge -- in fact, there were many warnings early on in the Reply All fiasco when folks were begging and pleading for someone -- anyone -- to jump in and control air traffic! There was too much time -- hours -- between the initial mess-up and the stove-piping from email to Twitter and then tothe blogs of the crme de la crme of marketing, PR, advertising, social media bloggers and -- wait for it -- journalists! There is a very valuable lesson here for one and for all. On the surface, it seems like the A-lister email blast and the open CC were the kill shots, but they were just contributing factors. Beth Brody and Brody PR, your error was in the realm of crisis management and a failure to respond. The message -- and mistake -- got away from you. It happens. But it is completely unacceptable not to cowboy up and throw yourself onto the grenade and practice a little mea maxima culpa marketing . Update from Beth Brody -- Via Email at 5:52PM: Dear Chris, I wanted to explain what happened today and apologize. I created a list of social media experts who might be interested in reviewing a new guide to social media for small biz. I inadvertently put the list name in the cc: box, rather than the bcc: box. A few folks must have hit the \"reply all\" button, rather than clicking on the \"unsubscribe link\" at the bottom, which started a stream of spam. Please accept my personal apology, albeit a little late in the day, since I was trying to remove everyone who wanted to be unsubscribed from the list immediately. I have deleted the offending list. Please let me know if you have any more questions about my mistake. Regards, Beth Chris Abraham is a partner in Socialmedia.biz and heads up special projects for Reputation.com . Contact Chris via email , follow him on Twitter and Google Plus or leave a comment below. Sad that companies such brody pr even play in this space. Strikes me as someone in their kitchen, pc on top of PR for dummies books trying to figure out how to email those who didn't request it. The bar is set way too low for PR firms. Most don't have a clue. I have to admit. I was on the list and yes Beth made a mistake however, who are these A list bloggers and journalists that can't figure out not to hit reply-all? Anyone who knows how to write an email knows how to reply and reply all. And after the many people replying-all to other people's pleas to stop replying all it because a mess. Hey Chris: I think the real story was the obnoxious behavior of everyone else on the list. While Beth Brody made a mistake, everyone who hit Reply to All and wrote obnoxious blog posts (which yours is not) consciously knew what they were doing. It was very rude and mean spirited. I don't think many of these people would have done it to her face. You are right that she had an opportunity to stop the anger if she just came out publicly quickly to apologize which she did eventually. Read my take on the whole case: Social media \"gurus\" and bloggers are egotistical jerks http://www.sparkminute.com/?p=915 Funny how Brody PR has done exactly what all the so-called A-listers and social media \"experts\" say they should do -- cry \"mea culpa!\" and apologize -- and yet are not getting any sort of \"Good for them for apologizing\" kind of messaging. I guess it's far easier to be snarky and cackle over someone's honest mistake instead of being a decent human being and saying, \"Good for you for correcting the problem.\" Remind me who is calling the pot and kettle black again? Disclaimer: I work for Empower MediaMarketing and this is my own opinion. Just to be clear, the names of people on the email list were NEVER revealed unless they chose to reply all, in which case it was obvious that they'd received the email (unless you've found some way to \"hack\" it?) The email address of the mailing list itself was all that was revealed, and whilst it should have been (a) hidden and (b) restricted, email addresses on the list weren't compromised if no action was taken by any individual. I'm not defending the action, but believe me it's very obvious when someone sends to everyone in the To: or Cc: fields -- this wasn't the case here. Oh, please. Stop vilifying Beth Brody. She made a mistake with the CC vs. BCC field. OK, I get that. It wasn't intentional, obviously, since Beth would know the ramifications. That they are calling her press release \"spam\" is absurd. She's just promoting some book. She made up a mail"}

It is very irritating because it seems as though he has no reason to meow. He is very well cared for--has plenty of food and water, gets a good amount of attention (petting and playing), etc. It often keeps me up at night or wakes me up too early in the morning, and I wasn't expecting that from a cat. My parents have had a few cats and none of them have been even nearly this loud. I've tried squirting him every time he meows for a few weeks now and he just doesn't get it (this was a suggestion on another webpage)--I've tried ignoring him and that doesn't work because he just keeps meowing. It's like he's a compulsive meower and even does it while he's eating or cleaning himself! I love the cat but he needs to learn how to quiet down! Has he done this since he was a kitten? How long has it been since his last vet visit? It could be that he doesn't feel well and is sort of \"needy feeling\" Does he also follow you around and seem restless? Hyperthyroid, diabetes to name a couple may cause him to be hyper. If he is not sick it could even be his diet, not enough or an imbalance of nutrients can leave some cats feeling very unsatisfied which can lead to odd behaviour. Do be sure to check as many health causes before starting with training. It would be sad to squirt him with water if he wasn't well! I'd be very concerned if he is meowing non-stop. __________________ I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. ~Voltaire Thanks Maya...I'm making an appt to have him checked out next week. The idea that he might not be feeling well never occurred to me and that wouldn't be nice to be squirting him with water if that's the case. I have refrained from that lately since it doesn't seem to be doing anything. If he isn't sick I'll try out the new diet. He may just need more play time. I live alone and he is a very social cat. Thank you for the suggestions! Once you rule out a potential health issue at the vets, perhaps it's time to consider getting a 2nd cat? I know there are others here on this board who advocate having 2 cats as they tend to amuse each other and don't always turn to you 24/7 for mental stimulation. Most folks will tell you it's not much more difficult to have 2 than one, personally, I have 2 dogs and although they still require a good deal of attention from me, they do keep each other occupied when I'm not home. Just a thought, good luck with your lil guy and I hope everything works out for you __________________ \"Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you\" Ralph Waldo Emerson it could be a health issue, it could also be emotional discomfort as well. When I adopted my Peanut from the spca, she was REALLY vocal. She used to meow all the time. She doesn't meow now as much, unless you go talk to her or unless she's in teh bathroom doing her daily routine of 5 second meowing with her imaginary friend in the bathroom. I don't know why she only meows in there. So i think that she used to be so vocal because of the changes in her life from her home, then to spca, then to my home with a new resident animal. Maybe your cat is experiencing stress as well, or maybe he's lonely, but some cats are generally vocal, so before you run and get another cat, consider the fact that he may not get over the meowing just because there's another animal. Raeday06, You are so totally welcome! I hope all goes well at the vet. The food forum here is a good place to look for information on what's healthiest and what to feed senior's or younger cats etc.. if you decide to switch, like i'm not sure if you know this but Iams is really unhealthy and can cause urinary blockage, so you need to be careful what you decide to switch to and how fast. It would need to be a gradual switch or they can get sick. I used vet food for a long time as well and later found out that it wasn't so hot either. Mine was a big time MEOWer also, very loving and expressive and like that even when he had his brother with him. He wasn't a non-stop meower though, I think that is unusual. Sometimes to quiet him down I gave him catnip toys with GOOD QUALITY health food store catnip which kept him busy because he'd put that in his mouth and slobber for a while!!! You could try keeping a supply on hand to give him if he wakes you up or you are busy. It's also possible he does just need a lot of attention, a friend or even a better view that includes some birds to watch! Good luck. __________________ I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. ~Voltaire It's like he's a compulsive meower and even does it while he's eating or cleaning himself! He may just be very neurotic. In this case, squirting him with water is only going to make it worse (or as you said, at least no better), because it will only give him something else to worry about. It could also be an uncontrollable behavior - kind of like tourettes in hum"}

Over the past few weeks, I've been feeling overwhelmed by messages about social media, and how best to market business online. I, like many of you, read and reread the same articles, opinions, and blogs, looking for some nugget of truth or wisdom, but in reality I just haven't found what I'm looking for. I'm told to be authentic, but to keep my writing short and to the point. What if I like big words? Should I skip the authenticity, and take things down a notch? I'm told to be real, but then I'm given lessons in small talk. How real is that? What if I just enjoy talking to people? Does it matter if you know who you are online? Yes, but not for the reasons many people might be telling you. It matters not so much to stake a claim on a few pixels of space, or to gain the title of \"expert.\" You need to know who you are to be effective. The truth of the matter is that, as Seth Godin says it, \"All marketers are liars.\" I don't care if you're selling a product, service, or by way of saying you're \"real and genuine\" or you're \"building community,\" you're trying to make money. You're selling something. That's OK, a lot of people are doing it really well , and I benefit -- you benefit. What turns me off is when I realize I've been daft to listen. We talk about \"content\" but don't challenge each other to think. So the challenge I give to you (and myself) today is this: Define your own voice, and speak from it. Be OK with the fact that it will grow and change over time. Understand that some people will like it, others won't. Overall, keep learning; keep experimenting. Eventually you'll have a stage -- you'll have an audience. The best part is they'll be yours, or your brand's, not someone else's. If you need some inspiration, take a look at Lauren Luke , a single mum from England with \"not many mates, and not much confidence\" who's found her voice on YouTube, and as a result of being real, an audience of millions."}

I think there are about 48 percent of Americans who might need the same kind of treatment. I decided to call a doctor. Even though I don't know any psychiatrists, I figured to get the best help I could. Since he has not been so busy for many years due to the death of his most famous patient, I called Dr. Vinnie BoomBatz, the former medical genius who had helped Rodney Dangerfield feel better about himself after getting no respect. Dr. Vinnie is not a Doctor of Psychology or Psychiatry, but he did have a sign on the wall of his office that read \"Don't Worry! I Stayed in a Holiday Inn Express.\" I knew I was at the right office when, while waiting, General David Petraeus came out after the seeing the doctor and seemed to be laughing. \"Next,\" Dr. Vinnie boomed! \"Mr. Lynn Roberts.\" \"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Roberts?\" the good doctor asked. I began to explain that since last Wednesday I had been seeing visions of Karl Rove's white board as I slept. I told the doctor that Rove seemed to be talking about Ohio and how the southern tip of Hamilton County had multiplied into millions of Republican votes while Cleveland was due a lake-effect snowstorm off Lake Erie. As a result, the President would get 3.2 percent fewer votes than in 2008 and Romney would whup up on him in the great state of Ohio. Dr. BoomBatz began to caress his chin and surmise. \"I see,\" he ventured. \"You seem to have a very serious case of Fantastical Presidential Elect-ilitus. You would not believe the number of cases I have seen this week. Tell me something about your daily schedule.\" \"Well, Doc, I wake up at about 5:00 in the morning. I turn my Joe DiMaggio Mr. Coffee Machine on, along with my laptop computer with the homepage of 'Real Clear Politics.' As my coffee makes, I read columns by Charles Krauthammer and Dick Morris. Dr. BoomBatz was not even taking notes. He had heard this before. \"After a few columns, I turn on the television to \"Way Too Early\" with Willie Geist. After Willie, there is Morning Joe and Fox and Friends. I watch those programs for a while then switch to radio. There is Glenn Beck, Laura Ingraham, and Rush Limbaugh.\" I continued, \"After Rush rants and raves for a few hours, I go back to television and it is switching back and forth between Fox and MSNBC. It all came to a head last Tuesday and I have had trouble sleeping ever since. What can I do?\" \"No worries,\" he said. \"I'll write you a prescription that should work.\" I looked at the prescription. It read: \"Rip Van Winkle Pills (Good for four years of sleep).\""}

And while it's an element of business education that has been around for years, such events as the Enron scandal and the Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme have brought this discipline to the forefront. \"Scandals are good for business when it comes to business ethics,\" explains Andrew Crane , director of the Centre of Excellence in Responsible Business at York's Schulich School of Business in Toronto. And thanks to scandals and the economic meltdown, even the fight to get ethics onto the syllabus has changed, he explains. \"A number of years ago it was something that we had to make more of argument to have included on the curriculum or we had to convince students of the necessity of it,\" Dr. Crane says. \"The last few years that's very much not the case,\" reported The Globe and Mail Nov. 5.

Executive training with a twist Companies increasingly need to put a global spin on their training needs, says Alan Middleton , executive director of the Executive Education Centre at York's Schulich School of Business in Toronto, reported The Globe and Mail Nov. 5 in an article about flexibility and brevity in executive training. His centre's focus is on Brazil, India, Russia and China, with programs for managers of Canadian and overseas firms. \"More and more organizations have to think globally about how the international environment affects their business,\" he says.

Not a good one in some cases, because only by taking on risk can most people achieve the returns needed to reach their financial goals.

Cooper cuts through the complexity of international affairs and highlights the importance of different 'worlds' of global governance in the twenty-first century. In short postings, the blog will showcase how these worlds both work together and collide. How should we mark the BRICS in terms of artistic expression? Leaders raise their arms together during the group picture for the BRICS 2012 Summit in New Delhi, India (AP Photo/Saurabh Das). There is an ongoing debate about the logic of using acronyms for clustering ascendant or rising states. The BRICS -- a concept originally formulated by Goldman Sachs as BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and translated into action through summits at both the level of foreign ministers and state leaders since 2009 -- has gained the most prominence. On top of application through various criteria of economic capacity (gross domestic product, rates of economic growth, foreign direct investment etc), there is also the image of the extended BRICS (the BRICs plus South Africa) animating an impressive form of soft, symbolic or cultural power. At first glance the soft power argument seems to have some attractive validity. This is especially true of the BRICS pushing to host major sporting/cultural events. The 2008 Beijing Olympics stands out, but the collective desire of the BRICS to attract attention concerning their rise can also be seen by South Africa's successful hosting of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Brazil's grabbing both the 2016 Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Russia's hosting of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and (although more problematically) India's hosting of the 2010 Commonwealth games. Yet the limits of any clustering of the BRICS can be seen by two very different standards of performance. One limitation, as I see it, is the difference in terms of performance. In terms of results, as measured for example by current medal count (as of Tuesday a.m. EST) at the London Olympics: Russia is still very much a force (with 42 medals) although with an image of decline not ascendancy; Brazil (8 medals) and South Africa, somewhat lower down (4 medals with 3 gold), have some admirable results but they are clustered with or below other countries that would be categorized as middle powers or lower; and the unreliability of the BRICS as a guide to performance can be seen by the radically uneven performance of China and India. At one end of the spectrum, China challenges and may surpass the traditional champion (hegemon!) of global sports, the United States. On Tuesday a.m. China has 65 medals with 32 gold and many varieties of star turns. At the other end of the spectrum, India (even with the infusion of some considerable funding from the Mittal Champions Trust) struggles to get any significant results (3 medals and no gold so far). Therefore, instead of BRICS what we see is a Cr(i)bs with China dominating the other states and with India almost invisible. The animation of soft power, however, goes much further than Olympic success. In addition to the hosting of major events such as the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, the other sign of a \"rising\" power is the identification of a country with a globally recognized brand -- a qualitative assessment to be sure! In the case of Brazil and India this type of branding has been reached -- with Bollywood and Carnival. South Africa -- although more fragile -- still has some of the aura of the Rainbow Nation. Although full of stellar individual achievements in the arts as in sports, it is less clear what the global brand is for China and Russia when the measurement is moved from the competitive to the symbolic sphere. The image of the BRICS is therefore quite paradoxical. In a quantitative assessment such as in the Olympics, China stands out with Russia in terms of results. On overall soft power branding, in terms of distinctive and attractive global brands, nevertheless, Brazil and India -- and to some extent South Africa -- seem to have the advantage. This lack of comparative advantage in global branding is reinforced, moreover, by the lack of Chinese companies in the Interbrand's global top 100 list. The distinctions between China and Russia on one side and Brazil, India, and South Africa on the other side is reinforced by some key controversies in the former countries over the limits of what can be termed a broader qualitative mark in terms of artistic expression. While the Olympics have dominated attention over the last ten days, the international media continues to focus on Ai Weiwei, the dissident Chinese artist, whose work continues to combine extraordinary beauty (as illustrated by the pavilion he collaborated on at the outdoor Serpentine Gallery in London opened without his presence during the Olympics) and an intensely critical examination of the Chinese state. In a parallel fashion, it is the trial of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot that has grabbed attention. Akin to Ai Wewei, the three women band-members on "}

The ITC panel voted against the Coalition of American Solar Manufactuers' claim of critical circumstances, which would have seen countervailing and anti-dumping duties imposed retroactively to the date CASM originally filed its two petitions -- October 19, 2011. A Commerce Dept. WTO panel on Oct. 10 issued its final determination on anti-dumping duties to be imposed on imports of silicon PV cells and panels from China. The ITC's ruling on Chinese government subsidies to its domestic manufacturers brings to a close what's been a controversial, fiercely debated issue that's divided the U.S. solar manufacturing industry into opposing camps represented by CASM on the one side and the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy (CASE) on the other -- at least in terms of U.S. international trade litigation. Gaming International Trade \"Today's unanimous vote by the International Trade Commission confirms what has been apparent in the marketplace for the past two years -- Chinese manufacturers, with the enthusiastic support of the Chinese government, have attempted to game the international trading system in order to gain a virtual monopoly on solar cells and modules sales in the U.S. market,\" commented Gordon Brinser , president of SolarWorld Industries America, the lead litigant in filing the two WTO petitions with the Commerce Dept. \"We have seen the results of this campaign in the marketplace, with more than a dozen companies either shutting down manufacturing facilities or significantly cutting back production and employment in the United States and a Chinese industry, led by LDK Solar and Suntech, having to increasingly turn to its national and provincial governments for help to survive. \"With this relief, combined with an aggressive domestic enforcement regime, there is hope that the United States can maintain a viable solar manufacturing base, conduct ongoing research and development and continue to make solar an increasingly viable part of the American renewable energy portfolio. On behalf of the membership of CASM, I want to thank the commissioners and the ITC staff for the hard work on this case.\" Encouraging Dialogue \"Today's expected decision by the ITC marks the end of a distracting and politically-charged trade case between the U.S. and China regarding imports of solar cells. Although this ruling was anticipated given the ITC's low threshold for injury determinations, we are nevertheless disappointed that they have left in place the Commerce Department's tariffs on solar cell imports. Fortunately, the scope of the decision is unchanged and is limited to solar cells produced in China, thereby minimizing harm to the U.S. solar industry,\" CASE president Jigar Shah, a partner in Inerjys, a $1 billion fund that invests in clean energy via growth capital and project finance, stated in response to the ITC's final determination. \"We will continue to encourage dialogue and negotiation between the U.S. and Chinese governments to seek a constructive resolution. Unilateral tariffs and a trade war in today's interconnected global marketplace are unnecessary and detrimental to effective and efficient business competition. \"Going forward, we must avoid a repeat of the SolarWorld saga, as the growth of the solar industry here, in Europe, and around the world is too important to be upended by one company's self-serving crusade. Fortunately, the scope of the decision is unchanged and is limited to solar cells produced in China, thereby minimizing harm to the U.S. solar industry.\" Commenting on the ITC's finding against CASM's claim of critical circumstance, CASE commented, \"We are pleased that the ITC has determined that there were no critical circumstances, and thus no reason to apply the tariffs retroactively. This means that tariffs will not apply to modules made with Chinese cells that were imported into the U.S. during the period of the investigation.\" Solar PV & International Trade Litigation: More to Come We haven't heard the last on this issue, however. The European Commission on Sept. 7 decided it has received sufficient evidence from the EU ProSun group of European solar PV manufacturers to investigate claims that Chinese silicon PV wafer, cell and panel manufacturers are dumping product in the European Union (EU) market. Results are expected around June. The Chinese government, for its part, on Nov. 5 filed a complaint with the WTO asserting that some European governments' subsidies are in \"violation of WTO prohibitions on import replacement subsidies, seriously affect Chinese exports, and harm China's rightful interests as a WTO member,\" according to a BBC News report .

Psoriasis is a common skin condition, characterised by red scaly thickened patches (plaques). It ofen affects the scalp. Scalp psoriasis may occur in isolation or with any other form of psoriasis. The back of the head is a common site for psoriasis, but multiple discrete areas of the scalp or the whole scalp may be affected. Scalp psoriasis is characterised by thick silvery-white scale over well-defined red thickened skin. Psoriasis may extend slightly beyond the hairline ( facial psoriasis ). Scalp psoriasis, even though often adequately camouflaged by the hair, is often a source of social embarrassment due to flaking of the scale and severe 'dandruff'. Scalp psoriasis may not cause any symptoms at all or may be extremely itchy. It tends to be a chronic problem, lasting many years, although it often fluctuates in severity and extent. In very severe cases there may be some temporary mild localised hair loss but scalp psoriasis does not cause permanent balding. Sebopsoriasis Sebopsoriasis is an overlap between psoriasis and another common skin condition, seborrhoeic dermatitis . There tends to be less silvery scale than psoriasis and more yellowish, greasy scale. Sebopsoriasis tends to localise to the scalp, face and anterior chest in a similar pattern to that seen in seborrhoeic dermatitis. But sebo-psoriasis has a deeper red colour, more defined margins and a thicker scale than typically seen in seborrhoeic dermatitis alone. It is also less likely to clear up with anti-dandruff shampoo. Pityriasis amiantacea Pityriasis amiantacea is characterised by thick, yellow-white scales densely coating the scalp skin and adhering to the hairs as they exit the scalp. The scales are arranged in an overlapping manner like tiles on a roof or flakes of asbestos, hence the name. The underlying scalp skin may appear normal, aside from the scale, or may be reddened or scaly. Pityriasis amiantacea is often present without any obvious underlying cause, but may be associated with psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis or lichen simplex (another form of dermatitis). Pityriasis amiantacea usually affects only part of the scalp but may occasionally involve the whole scalp. Some hair loss is common is areas of pityriasis amiantacea. The hair regrows normally if the condition is effectively treated. Hairs may be pulled out by combing due to the very adherent, thick scale at the base of the hair shafts. If additional complications such as infection occur then hair loss may be associated with scarring but bald areas are rarely permanent. The term tinea amiantacea is incorrect, because fungal infection, tinea capitis , is a very rare reason for this type of scaling. Scalp care Scalp psoriasis requires slightly different regimes from psoriasis affecting the skin elsewhere. This is due to hair, which makes application of many topical products difficult and protects the scalp from the effects of ultraviolet light. Unfortunately, many scalp treatments for scalp psoriasis are messy and smelly. Most treatments will need to be used regularly for several weeks before a benefit is seen. Coal tar shampoos are suitable for most patients with scalp psoriasis. Ketoconazole , ciclopirox, zinc pyrithione and other antifungal shampoos are effective for dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis. They have varying effect in sebopsoriasis and psoriasis. The shampoos work best if rubbed into the scalp well, and left in for 5 or 10 minutes and then reapplied. They are safe for daily use but may irritate if applied more than twice weekly. If you dislike the smell of coal tar , try shampooing again with a favourite brand, and use a conditioner. More severe cases require leave-on scalp applications. Alcohol-based, foam, gel or lotion forms of topical steroid and calcipotriol can reduce redness and itch but they don't lift scale very well. Use topical steroids intermittently; overuse results in more extensive and severe psoriasis. Salicylic acid and coal tar creams work much better, but are messy. Coconut oil compound ointment is a combination of coal tar, salicylic acid and sulphur and seems particularly effective. Leave on for at least an hour and shampoo off later. Most people rub the cream into the plaques at night and wash it off in the morning. Dithranol may be effective but is difficult to use and may be messy as it stains hair and fabrics. Use the scalp preparation daily at first then as the condition improves, reduce the frequency. Unfortunately in many cases the scale soon builds up again, so the creams may have to be applied regularly to keep the scalp clear. Topical steroids are best used only 2-3 times weekly, long term to avoid complications. Cutting hair short helps control scalp psoriasis, probably by making the treatments easier to apply, but is not appealing to everyone. Phototherapy is effective for chronic plaque psoriasis but difficult to deliver to the scalp. Special targeted devices and UVB combs have been d"}

Check out our top 10 tips to help you beat fatigue and ensure you get the most out of yourself and your day! We've all been there: those days when you wake up shattered, can barely drag yourself into work, and then struggle to keep your head off the desk. More often than not this is because you had a particularly late night which has left your body crying out for more sleep. On the other hand, sometimes you may be getting to bed in good time, thinking you'll get a good night's sleep, and yet when the morning arrives you still feel like every waking thought and movement is a real effort. Here's 10 tips to help you beat fatigue: Get enough sleep It may be stating the obvious, but to avoid tiredness you should ensure you get enough sleep! Remember that your body needs sleep in order to recharge -- and staying up and watching a movie which starts at midnight isn't going to help! If you are having any trouble sleeping, then aim to have a better sleep routine such as going to bed and getting up at the same time. You could also improve your sleeping environment by making sure your bedroom is quiet, dark and comfortable. Also, by using your bedroom for sleep alone, your body will come to associate it with sleeping rather than reading or watching TV. Try to avoid stress Stress is one of the most common reasons for feeling tired -- so beating stress will naturally help to alleviate your tiredness. There are several ways in which to tackle stress, but the most important thing to do is identify what is causing your stress in the first place. It may be work that is the main cause of your stress -- perhaps because of bad work relationships, long hours, or an unfulfilling job. If that's the case, then look at your options about how you can improve the situation. Also, make sure you switch off from work in your leisure time, and try out some relaxation techniques such as having a massage, taking a hot bath or listening to some music. Improve your diet and eat well Your diet can have a big impact on how you feel. Without a proper, balanced diet you can start to feel a bit sluggish and are likely to become fatigued -- so ensure that you eat healthy meals and at the correct times. Skipping breakfast will ensure you start your day on the wrong footing and force you to run on empty until lunchtime! Eating 'little and often' can work for some people, as it means that they've got something to sustain them rather than going for longer periods between meals -- which will help them to avoid the feeling of being hungry and tired prior to their main meals. Keeping blood sugar levels stable is also important to avoid fatigue -- so make sure you eat enough carbohydrates. Avoid caffeine in the evening While caffeine might be great for giving you a boost in the daytime, and while some people just can't do without their early morning wake-up cuppa, by the evening time you really need to start thinking about laying off the caffeine unless you want to get a restless night's sleep! Caffeine -- contained in things such as tea, coffee, chocolate and cola drinks -- can cause restlessness and sleeping difficulties, which will only add to your tiredness the next day. It may also result in you needing more caffeine to keep you going -- so it's best to try and break the cycle by cutting down on the amount of caffeine you drink. Slow down People frequently get in the habit of trying to do too much. The demands they are putting on themselves may leave them feel fatigued -- and if there are not enough hours in the day to juggle their job, family and friends, then they may end up not getting enough sleep either. On the other hand, having a more balanced lifestyle, making some time for yourself, and learning to relax and slow down sometimes will mean you'll be more able to function efficiently. Think about what you could change to give yourself more time for relaxation. It's also best to have realistic expectations about what you can achieve rather than running yourself into the ground! Exercise to boost your energy levels Physical activity is a great way of boosting your energy levels and avoiding fatigue. If you're unfit, then that generally makes you feel tired, and being tired means you won't feel like exercising! You may have to break this cycle of inactivity to get yourself feeling less tired and more energized. Just introduce some physical activity into your routine -- even if this means simply getting off the bus a few stops earlier and walking the rest of the way to work, or even cycling in. Of course, if you can also fit in some other exercise into your day, such as running, swimming or going the gym, then great. Just make sure you keep it regular and that it fits in with your life. Drink adequate amounts of water Don't forget to keep hydrated throughout the day, as this can also help to pr"}

The All Saints Church in Lawrence is one of five Anglican churches in the Maclean parish. All Saints warden Terry Bird said the Grafton diocese had ordered a review of Maclean Parish and wanted one, possibly two, local churches to close. \"As in many other country dioceses, the Grafton diocese has requested the Maclean Parish review the number of centres and reduce the number by at least one,\" Mr Bird said. \"As members of our beautiful riverside community are aware, we have a solid foundational history in the Lower Clarence.\" Mr Bird and other members of the congregation have arranged a public meeting to be held this Saturday and are calling for public support. They will present a petition at the meeting, which at the moment has the signatures of more than 100 people. \"We'll be going down to the election polling booths on Saturday to get as many signatures as possible,\" said Mr Bird. He said there had been \"talk\" the diocese was looking to close some churches for more than a year. \"It seems to have come to a head with calls for these meetings,\" he said. Mr Bird said All Saints had helped the diocese cope with financial problems arising from building the Clarence Valley Anglican School senior campus. \"We donated a block of land we had at the school to the Bishop's Appeal,\" he said. Grafton Diocese Archdeacon Greg Ezzy will be at Saturday's meeting to discuss the issue with parishioners. \"Faithful parishioners have enjoyed many years of worship, service, and fellowship together,\" Mr Bird said. \"The community has gathered to share weddings, baptisms, and funerals through the decades. \"We in Lawrence need your support to keep our church open; not for just our generation, but to consider our growing community and those of future generations.\" Mr Bird said the original All Saints Church in Lawrence was built in 1868, while the existing heritage-listed building was constructed in 1903. The public meeting will be held at All Saints Anglican Church, High St, Lawrence, this Saturday at 2pm."}

He seems to have settled down to a level of work and prominence of the sort that he had before Lakeland with some minor changes. He's not based in Canada any more, and ministers here infrequently. Ministering anywhere near his old ministry base, in Abbotsford B.C., near where his kids may still, presumably live, seems to be something he won't be doing soon. He's keeping the habit of not ministering in many big Cities, with the attendant possibility of media coverage. Rather, he works close enough to cities and airports so that a fan, if they are determined enough, can come see him. He seems to be ministering outside of North America with the same frequency as he did before he became famous to the average Christian. But his history is tagging along behind him like a little puppy as readers of a small English newspaper realized about a week or so ago. I'm guessing that this comes from the local newspaper in Croydon , England. Croydon is one of the southern suburbs of London, inside the region of London. Bentley is scheduled to hold a series of meetings there from August 30 to September 1. And I think, judging by what they wrote, the reporter will be waiting for Bentley when they show up. There are no new quotes from Bentley, but the reporter has done their homework. They refer, high up in the story, to Bentley's claims to heal people by beating them up and his time in jail as a teen after he molested a child. The \"face-kicking faith healer\" reference relates to one night at Lakeland, when Todd Bentley started talking about the odd things that \"God\" would have him do when praying for people on other occasions. It's probably his most infamous clip on YouTube, in various forms. The reporter could have easily quoted this particular video clip where at 0:40, Bentley starts to say this: \"...And I'm thinking why is the power of God not moving? And He [God} said, 'Because you haven't kicked that woman in the face' {Shot of Stephen Strader in the crowd, laughing] And there is this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the Holy Spirit spoke to me. The gift of faith comes on me. He {the Holy Spirit] said 'Kick her in the face with your biker boot. I inched closer and I went Bam! {Makes full hard kicking motion with his right leg] and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of God...\" [Radio apologetics  Todd Friel, playing this and other clips from the same sermon on his program was not only dismayed, but puzzled too. He said \"What are they laughing at, exactly? He's hurting people...\" ] The writer for the Croydon Advertiser was no doubt also warned by the national Express tabloid newspaper, which has done fine coverage of Todd Bentley. Most recently, last December, their story on his first visit to Britain in years ran with the headline \" Beware of the tattoo preacher \" Interesting note at the end of the story. The Croydon conference center that Todd has rented for his meetings is owned by a local church, Folly's End Community Fellowship. Bentley is listing the church as a co-host of the meetings, the story reports, but the pastor of the church is paraphrased as taking pains to note that they merely hired out the facilities to Bentley and nothing more. The church has \"nothing to do with the event\". Thus the church's name might prove to be prophetic, one could say. 31 Responses to English reporter looks at Todd Bentley in the same way that they would look at a used car That statement by TB still makes me feel tense and sick! Not only what he said but the laughing, clapping and cheering of the sheeple. I woke up as tho I had been slapped in the face and four years later still grieve at my own involvement and friends still under strong delusion. When speaking to a \"christian\" friend at the time I was shocked and dismayed when they weren't fazed ( they actually thought he was wonderful). This lady said Jesus did that when He put clay in the blind mans' eyes?!!? I have learned that people will make outrageous statements twisting scripture to protect their latest idol of signs and wonders -- indeed the delusion is great. Many years ago I also heard Kenneth Copeland claim god told him to punch a man in the stomach and maybe Smith Wigglesworth too. TB's visa application to Australia was rejected earlier this year and I they never let him in -- wont stop people supporting him andhis promoters tho. Did Bentley actually kick a woman in the face, or did he just claim to have done so? Let's get past the sensationalism and deal with facts. Either he kicked the woman or it is a lie. If it's a lie, Bentley is a liar. However, it is inaccurate to publish Bentley's claim as if it is true. Certainly, anyone familiar with all the stories that the healing evangelists of the last century"}

Experiments in political subjectivity The possibility of conceiving practices of citizenship after orientalism points to experiments that uncover, rearticulate and provoke subjugated forms of politics. Through addressing the intersections between orientalism, colonialism and citizenship (panel 1), exploring possibilities of democratic politics for decolonizing citizenship (panel 2) and troubling universal claims to rights (panel 3), we ask what images of citizenship are emerging in relation to the process of deorientalization? It is this experimentation itself, rather than its outcomes, that constitutes 'citizenship after orientalism' as a field of investigation. The Oecumene Project team members discuss their first collective publication, a double Special Issue of Citizenship Studies entitled, 'Citizenship After Orientalism: An Unfinished Project.' Published half way through the European Research Council funded project, this is its first statement on how citizenship has been understood as a narrowly western concept and what techniques researchers can use to write about citizenship after orientalism. With a global reach and a blend of approaches from anthropology to legal studies, from history to sociology, from postcolonial to European studies, the Special Issue shows how widely orientalism has shaped our understanding of the citizen and how innovative the field can be once we attempt to write about citizenship after orientalism."}

Sara el-Yafi is deeply offended, even outraged by the Israeli buffet menu, and Harvard rushes to accommodate her. Islamic supremacists such as Hamas-linked CAIR play the outrage card again and again in the U.S. because they know that when they do, frightened dhimmi officials will hasten to give them everything they want. \"Harvard 'deeply troubled' by row over Israeli buffet,\" by Charles Bybelezer for the Jerusalem Post , November 9 (thanks to Benedict): Harvard Business School is \"deeply troubled\" for having offended Arab sensibilities due to the mischaracterization of various foods appearing on the menu of the dining room's Israeli Mezze Station, Brian Kenny, chief marketing and communications officer of the school, was quoted by Al-Arabiya as saying Friday. The controversy over the Israeli food station arose after Lebanese Harvard graduate Sara el-Yafi on October 28 posted to her Facebook page a letter of protest to the university describing the Israeli buffet's menu as an affront to Arabs, as such foods as humous and couscous are not of Israeli origin. \"That 'Israeli Mezze Station\" is the ultimate multicultural, multireligious 'f*** you' in the face of ALL Arabs at once from North Africa to the Levant,\" el- Yafi wrote. \"Israel already has a hard time keeping face in the Arab world for the way it has 'appropriated' its lands since 1948, don't make it worse for them by having them appropriate other peoples' foods as well,\" she added. El-Yafi also pointed out that haloumi cheese is in fact \"Cypriot,\" and therefore \"until Cyprus becomes another conquered Israeli territory, haloumi is considered NOT Israeli.\" She concluded that at the very least the buffet should be renamed \"Mediterranean Mezze Station.\" In response to el-Yafi's Facebook protest, which as of Friday had garnered more than 4,500 \"likes,\" Kenny reportedly said that \"we are deeply troubled that we offended anybody by doing this buffet item, particularly considering that our reason for doing the international buffet each day is to celebrate cultural diversity.\" \"We've been following the comments and the [Facebook] posts,\" Kenny continued, which have \"prompted us to have some extensive conversations here internally... to understand how this happened and to make sure that it doesn't happen again.\" Categories : 23 Comments \"That 'Israeli Mezze Station\" is the ultimate multicultural, multireligious 'f*** you' in the face of ALL Arabs at once from North Africa to the Levant,\" el- Yafi wrote. ........................... Ludicrous. If a buffet had had a \"Syrian Food Station\", say, and also featured humous and couscous and that infamous Cypriot cheese, no one would have batted an eye. And the fact is, no one knows where many of these foods originated -- many of them are centuries old. An Israeli food journalist set out a few years ago -- rather whimsically -- to settle the question of whether falafel was an Arab or a Jewish invention. It turned out, from her research, that falafel had almost certainly been developed by Coptic Christians as a dish for meatless Fridays. Are the Copts demanding their dish back? I think not... Also, note how Sara el-Yafi hammers away on these foods \"not being Israeli\" -- even though many of them have been enjoyed by Jews in the Levant for hundreds of years. The fact is, that foods are some of the most mobile of all cultural artifacts. For instance, several of the foods we think of as being most iconically Italian are new world foods like the tomato and peppers. The same is true of potatoes in northern European cuisines. And this isn't some \"colonial\" thing -- it works both ways. That famous Hawaiian bread certainly wasn't originally indigenous to the islands. But -- of course -- this is *not* about food. This is merely yet another attempt to label the Jews of Israel as \"foreign\" invaders -- despite the fact that they predate the existence of Muslims in the region by *milllenia*, and that all Muslims in the region were originally Arabian invaders. Well, that seems reasonable to me. If humous and couscous are not really Israeli then they should not be portrayed as Israeli. But only on the condition that the 1001 Islamic inventions that are not really 'Muslim' should not be portrayed as Muslim. You see, it works both ways and Muslims really are the last people on Earth with a right to complain about misrepresentation. Seriously? This Islamadoodle Harvard student doesn't have anything better to do? Apparently, even brunch has been politicized to stink of anti-Semitism and Jew Hatred. Where to begin? First- the history of the \"art of cooking.\" Yes, food preparation has a \"history\", cuisine arts have a \"past.\" Sadly, even whats in the 'frig can have its history be appropriated by Islamadoodles.

Buffering has had 11 of his 28 starts in Group I company but the likes of Black Caviar and Hay List have cast shadows over some remarkable performances from the son of Mossman, causing him to rack up seven minor placings at the highest level. However, Black Caviar and Hay List will be in spelling paddocks while Buffering leads out the Manikato Stakes field on Friday night. Heathcote said Buffering's Group II wins at his first two runs this time in have him at his top for his $750,000 assignment. \"Buffering, he's about as good as I can get him,\" Heathcote said. \"There will be no excuses whatsoever for him (if he is beaten).\" Buffering overcame a tardy start to dominate the Moir Stakes (1200m) from the front when resuming over the Manikato Stakes course last month but settled second behind three-year-old filly Malasun before sprinting strongly to win the Schillaci Stakes (1000m) at Caulfield on October 13. Heathcote said Buffering's inside draw of barrier one gave jockey Hugh Bowman the flexibility to either share the speed or race behind the leaders without spending too much energy early. \"He's drawn a nice alley for him, he doesn't have to work too hard,\" Heathcote said. \"What you see is what you get and what we saw the other day was a horse that can take a sit, travel and finish strongly.\" Buffering's supporters have been keen to back their favourite. The five-year-old has firmed from $2.15 into$2 at Luxbet while Iasbet affiliates.com/_SP7pYp5aOCModpemNzoV8mNd\\\\... have supported him from $2.10 into $2. Alex2011 Hey TJ Sea Siren led in the Doomben 10,000 and Hallowell Belle led at its last start. Don't think they are going to let the Buff get an easy lead. addo I reckon lone rock at $9 is pretty good TJ Hey Alex, all those you mentioned as potential leaders, when was the last time any of them led a race? Alex2011 I think the people who think Buff will get a soft lead better have a look at the form. There are potentially 3 to 4 leaders in this race inc Buff (Sea S, HB or Sat Sh are others) and that is why barrier 1 could be a disadvantage if you miss the start a shade. I think Ready to Rip will turn the tables on the Buff. aax Hawk88...I like your boldness but is it misplaced with Buff?? He is probably 3rd best in Oz behind mighty BV and HL. Loves MV...lead or sit...won easy last start. U know something we dont. Personally I think Buff will be mighty hard to beat... BTS Barrier 1 disadvantage as theres a few that fly out the gates and if he is even a touch slow he wont be leading and if that happens he will need to be every bit as good as they say Shane We're Gonna Rock eachway. Can't see it missing a hole. Going to win a nice race this preparation. accas hawk 88 you obviously know very little about Buffering, sounds like you're about to get taught a lesson. chief Hawk 88 if the Buff is such a big lay what price are you offering. Will start in the red, he's moral. glen Your kidding hawk, when has barrier 1 been a disadvantage to a on speed runner.He deserves this group1 win, should have won doomben 10000 and stradbroke. Copped bad barriers and rides. Go the buff! TJ Hawk, since when has barrier 1 ever been a disadvantage for a leader? Also who is going to attack him and kill their own chances? Bart Nuggett I like him to win.Only 2 decent horses in the race. awk 88 Buffering is a huge lay in this race. Barrier 1 is disadvantage as if he leads he will be attacked and if he takes sit he won`t get the picnic he got last start sitting off a tearaway leader with a gap to others. Lots of chances so bring on betfair to lay him."}

I'll let you check it out for yourself, but the gist of the ad is that dudes should make sure their hair situation is handled, because the ladies always notice the hair first. And, just to make sure you don't forget, the male character in the ad is a big lump of brown hair (ew). O.K. the new guy has a full head of hair, check. And what about the lady that's noticing this well-coifed mop? Her hair must be every bit as fabulous, right? Because if ladies look at the hair first, then the guys must...oh, wait. My bad. The female character in this ad is just a pair of perky tits. No head, no legs even, just cleavage. My friends and I gaped at the screen in amazement, then all laughed a little uncomfortably when one friend announced cheerfully, \"that must be a throwback to the 70's or something! Shit like that doesn't happen anymore!\" Sigh. Yes, I know it's the 21 st century and all, and we have robots on Mars and computers in our pockets, and women are taking over in all sorts of awesome ways, but guess what. Sexism is, sadly alive and kicking. No really, I'm not making this up. I myself had the pleasure of encountering a few unbelievably retro-sexist situations myself in the not-so-distant past. Here's what happened and here is how I dealt with them. How about retitling this post \"Three ways to NOT deal with off-putting remarks -- if you want to build a career\". ====== Situation 1: You write, \"Strangely, I was never asked to attend another pitch meeting again after that.\" I don't blame you for being upset, but did you put an extra flourish into showing your boss up? If so, that's part of how you screwed yourself. There are clues throughout this writeup that you enjoy showing up men when you get the chance -- starting with that crack on the first page about \"women are taking over in all sorts of awesome ways\". Let's notice that he received no support from the other men present, and that the others are aware of his limitations (the idea that they ought to have told the head of the company to \"go to hell\" or anything amounting to that is ridiculous). Even if it was necessary and \"quickly jump in\" to save the presentation, there are graceful ways to do this. Further, him having a personal fiasco like this offers a chance to tell him later, \"I'm pleased I was able to support you and our team today, and I'm delighted we were successful. Helping the company find the best ways to present our strengths and build the relationship with the client was a valuable experience for me.\" Everyone will get the message, including him, and you're showing you know how deal with challenging situations while keeping everyone on side. Snappy comebacks are not the answer, because the larger goal isn't to put him in his place. The goal is to get him to recognize your worth to him and his own goals, and to get him working on your behalf to further your career. A boss who has fears about their own competence can become your biggest supporter if you show you forgive and accept them, and want to help them. As Abraham Lincoln put it, \"Do I not destroy my enemies when I make friends of them?\" One other thing: on the web we encounter a lot of snotty, wet-behind-the-ears high-fiving when a woman triumphs over a man. A woman who wants to succeed -- especially someone who wants to lead in an organization -- needs to drop that unworthy urge like a hot potato, and go read Dale Carnegie's \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\". ========== Situation 2: You deliberately used your clothing to bait remarks, and now think you can complain when you get remarks? You were messing with them like they're props in your personal drama. Your sense of entitlement is showing there, and underscored by \"My performance has nothing to do with how much leg I'm showing. Right?\". Fascinating... you can do whatever you want, but everyone else has to be exquisitely careful what they say to you or they're sexist dinosaurs. That said, you're right that most comments about someone else's clothing have no place in the office. One way to discourage repeat remarks is to say something like, \"Thanks, but my focus here is on the job.\" The problem with making remarks back like \"that's a great color on you\" is that undercuts removes your own ability to take a strong stand if someone else won't back off. One difficult problem is what to do about women discussing their clothing when there are men around. That's part of how women socialize, but it's hard to have one's cake and eat it. Either the topic is legit, or it isn't. If it isn't then we have to gently say something that amounts to, \"I'd love to talk about that with you later.\" ========== Situation 3: \"I had a dog named Honey once\" is another snappy comback, and o"}

Just about everybody has insurance for their vehicles.  Proof of insurance is one of those things the police officer asks for, in addition to your driver's licence and vehicle registration, whenever you get pulled over on a public roadway. In most countries, vehicle insurance is mandatory.  Of course, insurance is more about the driver than it is about the vehicle.  The quality and safety of driving usually determines the annual cost of an insurance policy.  This is especially so if the insurance policy ever needs to be claimed against. Here is something new to think about.  In North America, would you ever call your insurance agent and ask: \"Listen, I used to drive-and-get 24 MPG and now I drive-and-I get 30 MPG all the time, so how much of a discount on my policy premium do I get?\"  Shock and laughter is the predictable result. It is news then, that some commercial companies in the United Kingdom (UK) are negotiating substantial insurance reductions based on Global Positioning System (GPS) solutions.  To be sure, fleet wide solutions are a little more complex, but consider some thinking behind the GPS related solutions. GPS lets fleet managers know where the fleet's vehicles are operating.  GPS makes sure that fuel is not wasted, by pointing out to the driver the most direct route.   Better yet, GPS units with eco-route finding capabilities will calculate the best gas mileage route when it has to decide, for instance, between going over a mountain and driving the long way around the mountain. Two interesting, and beneficial, realities came to light in the UK fleet reports.  First, there were increased business efficiencies and reduced costs.    This is good all by itself.    Second, there was a reduction in unwanted events which then resulted in a better risk profile. The GPS recorders showed it all to be fact.   The fleet administrators were then able to negotiate with the insurance companies into reducing their insurance premiums by over 60,000 British pounds per policy unit. The reported example showed that improved gas-mileage fuel-efficiency, generally, is a good indicator of reduced driving costs and lower unwanted driver behaviours.    Let us ask the question again:  \"Do you think that good gas mileage experienced in the family car will put you in position to demand a reduction in your annual insurance premium?\" We are not talking about the good driver discount which is based on the number of claims against the policy, We are talking about your insurance company accepting the premise that good fuel economy is a primary indicator of a set of driving behaviours that lower risk. Further, that the lowered risk should be deserving of lower insurance premiums."}

He was white and averaged 20 lbs. Although the breed was said to be hypoallergenic, the vet said there is truly no such thing. Anderson Cooper (his name ) has since gone, but was a wonderful gentile dog. Is he very very allergic? I know, I know, you can't ask him to compromise his heath. But growing up I had two Boston Terriers and although they are not hypoallergenic, both my mother and sister who are allergic had no problems. Bostons' hair is short and coarse and they don't shed too much- an important factor since it reduces the amount of dander in the air. I presently have a Boston Terrier named Percival and with his sort snout and underbite he has the \"so ugly he's adorable\" look down pat Good luck!!"}

If you are in either of these two categories, it is a good idea to give the job to the professionals and employ someone to do it for you. With Analytics you can see how many hits your website is getting, which allows you to determine if you are getting any value from your website. It also gives you information on where visitors are coming from, ie if they are coming directly to it, or from one of your partnership sites or from search engines. This way you can see who is generating the most traffic to your website. For example, you may be paying to advertise in the Yellowpages online. Analytics will show you how many visitors found your site via Yellowpages, and you can determine whether that listing is working for you or not. You can see what countries the visitors are from. If for example, the greater percentage of your visitors and customers are from Spain or South America, you could look at having a Spanish language translation of your website available. You can see where people are leaving your site -  if people are visiting your 'price' page, or your 'product' page and then leaving, you know there is probably something that you can improve on these pages. If you are also using Google Adwords, you can combine the information with Analytics to find out exactly how much each lead is costing you. Analytics helps you see what you are doing right, and what you can improve -- an invaluable tool to increase the effectiveness of your website.

The five piece have just wrapped up filming tracks for The Hospital Club Sessions -- a series of groundbreaking videos filmed using 360 degree camera angles, allowing the viewer to select the camera and stance from which they wish to view the sessions. Celebrating with Refreshers and Wham! bars, the band chat enthusiastically about the videos that they've just created. \"We've done a few sessions recently, but that one was so slick -- totally pro! We brought the dangly lights ourselves, we made those over the weekend,\" says vocalist Andy Hunt, as we join him and bandmate Tom Gorton to find out what the band have been up to recently. We've heard there's been a move from your previous residence of Liverpool to the bright lights of the Big Smoke... Andy: There has been a move, and to be honest, it's quite reflective in the songs [on the latest EP]. Certainly two of them, 'Humbolts' and 'Everything All The Time' are about having to get used to a new environment and the fears that go with that. A feeling of ambition, balanced against nerves and being worried about what life is going to do, so the move's been really important in defining the mood of the EP. And it was made under quite difficult circumstances. We'd just moved so we all had to get jobs and stuff, so we were busy all the time and we were trying to write and record songs, so it was quite stressful in a way. I think the EP is quite tense and neurotic sounding, and I think that very much reflects the state of mind. Tom: But quite exciting as well, there's a lot of energy in the EP. Andy: Yeah, I like to think there's an optimism in the stuff we do, even if it's downcast. Light at the end of the tunnel. The EP feels very much like the culmination of the last 6 months being down in London. Having previously all lived in t he notorious Lodge in Liverpool, how has the ba nd dynamic changed now that you're dealing with a new city? Do you still all live and work together? A: We nearly all live together! Tom lives away... He has his independence! T: I live five minutes down the road. But Andy misses me. A: We used to be best friends. Until we moved to London. T: We're going to get back together, we'll all live together again eventually but yeah... Andy calls me. A lot. A: We're mostly all together though so the atmosphere has remained, and we work on music a lot together. We still live in each others pockets, but at the Lodge, there were more 'pockets' to dilute. It was amazing there because we were surrounded by people doing similar things, it was inspiring and we could have parties and stuff. I think I'll look back on it as being one of the most exciting times of my life. It was a definite phase of our existence. Photographer: Sara Amroussi-Gilissen As musicians, what kind of inspiration have you been able to take from such a big change? T: I think there's a reflection of us moving from somewhere that we know very well, where the pace of life is much different, it's much slower in Liverpool and I guess we knew every street and everywhere there was to go. Then we came down here and I think the impact as musicians has been reflected in the EP, and I guess when we're more settled here and doing our album, it might be slightly different. I don't think it's necessarily made us better musicians or anything like that, but in terms of the art of the output, there's been a really impact. A: I think we've all felt quite stretched to our full limits down in London, so I definitely think we're also trying to do that musically. Whether or not we'd be doing that in Liverpool... it definitely feels like an important change. And the band's work ethic, has that remained the same? A: We tend to write a lot... They don't always reach the end of the line, so we have a lot of scraps lying about. Sometimes we'll revisit, or we'll have an old song and rearrange it, we recycle things  lot. Because we've all played in lots of different bands and made music on our own, so we do a lot of looking back through files. T: We all make music independently as well and I guess we write things with the intention of them eventually being for Outfit, but a lot of it's just for fun as well, just messing around with different styles. It's good, it's exciting. A: We've got a lot of fragments of songs. We're trying to stock pile songs at the moment. We'll take this many and put them on the album, then the rest can just sit around for the next one! Maybe we'll get to three albums in and have no creativity left so we'll have to go back and recycle all of our ideas. T: Isn't that what Oasis did? A: I model most of what I do on what Oasis did. Speaking of the album, is there a date pencilled in yet -- and what's the next year looking like for Outfit? T: Early 2013 we hope, for the albu"}

I am abt 2 apply for student viza. I would appreciate help in regardzz wid docuements 2 b submitted @ the time of student visa lodging. Kindly correct me if i am missing some of the documentzz. Here is da List. Congratulations for getting a HEC scholarship to PhD program from a reputable university in Australia. Undoubtedly this is some thing a person should always be proud of. Your efforts and hard work has paid of. As per rules [University of Wollongong] comes in streamline processing which basically means that Embassy recognizes your university to be an authentic education provider. This makes an applicant's chances for obtaining a visa even brighter. Please follow the link to visa check-list below to submit your case to the Embassy. Assessment Levels have been streamlined meaning you will be treated the same as a student from United States. i.e Assessment Level 1 &lt; Reference: http://www.immi.gov.au/students/checklis\\\\... &gt; There is not need to notarize your statement of purpose(SOP). Your signature at the end are sufficient. Please write it persuasively and put some thought into it as it is a document of utmost importance. Undeniably visa officer will read your SOP and the outcome of the decision will be based on it. I hope it was helpful. Regards C.Sagan P.S- My semester will commence in spring for Masters of Professional Engineering from UOW this July 2012. FaizaJ May 6th, 2012, 10:50 AM Thank you C.Sagen for da info and complements. Yes, University of Wollongong is very nice university and very reputable one. Have you applied for da visa? hope 2 c u at Wollongong. By the way, is PFL a good consultant for australia visa cases handling? Thankzzz once again Carlsagan. carlsagan May 6th, 2012, 04:05 PM @FaizaJ The purpose of human existence should be to help others if we cannot they we should at least try not to harm others. The university is well known for research on Nano Technology. According the updated rankings it's research capabilities are higher than [University of Melbourne]. The program allows me to participate in thesis and contribute directly in my discipline. It is the one of those universities working on nano based solar panels that will eventually end the monopoly of oil cartels around 2030's. Shortage of energy will cause the biggest crisis mankind has ever faced in the future. The world relies heavily on energy, 90% of which comes from oil. Already the price of petrol as of 6th May 2012 is spiraling out of control. It is obvious that if an alternative is not discovered soon, immediate repercussions will be on the price of transportation that will reach beyond the grips of a common man,the price of commodities and overall living cost have been rising and are bound to go even higher in the years to come. In this regard some nations have invested in renewable energy technologies but they are ineffective on an industrial scale. The answer will come from [University of Wollongong, Nano Labs] where today researchers are looking for answer to these questions. That is what I hope to be a part of. I hope to strengthen the fabric of science. I worked in the middle east for few years to earn my tuition fees. My colleagues and boss is Australian and our Head Office is also based in Australia. I got the visa in 2 weeks time. It was difficult on HEC scholarship a few years ago as they were having trouble funding students already pursuing degree abroad. We were hearing news of Pakistani scholars returning home leaving their studies because HEC was unable to provide funds. May be situation has improved since them. This was in around the year 2007/08. I took a decision not to apply for HEC as they were in troubles of their own. In any case it is tremendous achievement to have your efforts recognized by government of Pakistan, considering the current situation. Being fully funded gives you the liberty to enjoy your stay while in Australia on a stipend. As for your queries, National Identity Cards are translated in shops around places where Notary Public sit outside court rooms. They are usually well advertised. One cannot miss their signboards. A translated NIC is a print out of a simple form built in excel with your data. It is nothing really sophisticated or amazing. The reputation of the consultant doesn't matter in your case. You are a sponsored student for research degree. You automatically meet the criteria of [Genuine Student] and [Temporary Entrant]. The only important pieces of paper in your application will be the letter from HEC and your statement of purpose.

Can any one elaborate about financial statement in scholarship case? @FaizaJ a"}

More About the Author \"Art Wolfe's photographs are a superb evocation of some of the most breathtaking spectacles in the world.\" -- Sir David Attenborough Over the course of his nearly 40-year career, photographer Art Wolfe has worked on every continent and in hundreds of locations. His stunning images interpret and record the world's fast-disappearing wildlife, landscapes and native cultures, and are a lasting inspiration to those who seek to preserve them all. Wolfe's photographs are recognized throughout the world for their mastery of color, composition and perspective. \"Art Wolfe's work tells a story that is overwhelming, breathtaking, and vast.\" - Robert Redford Wolfe's photographic mission is multi-faceted. His vision and passionate wildlife advocacy affirm his dedication to his work. By employing artistic and journalistic styles, he documents his subjects and educates the viewer. His unique approach to nature photography is based on his training in the arts and his love of the environment. His goal is to win support for conservation issues by \"focusing on what's beautiful on the Earth.\" Hailed by William Conway, former president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, as \"the most prolific and sensitive recorder of a rapidly vanishing natural world,\" Wolfe has taken an estimated one million images in his lifetime and has released over sixty books, including the award-winning \"Vanishing Act\", \"The High Himalaya\", \"Water: Worlds between Heaven & Earth, Tribes\", \"Rainforests of the World\", \"The Art of Photographing Nature\", as well as numerous children's titles. Graphis included his books \"Light on the Land\" and the controversial \"Migrations\" on its list of the 100 best books published in the 1990s. \"There's a stunning clarity and vibrancy in Art Wolfe's wildlife portraits, which are careful, often haunting, compositions.\" - The New York Times Book Review In 2000 he published his signature work \"The Living Wild\", which has more than 70,000 copies in print worldwide and garnered awards from the National Outdoor Book Awards, Independent Publisher, Applied Arts and Graphis. In 2001 WP published the award-winning \"Africa\", and in 2003 \"Edge of the Earth,Corner of the Sky\", which captured significant publishing awards, including IPPY (Independent Publishers), Benjamin Franklin (Publishers Marketing Association), and National Outdoor Book Award.

Since there's so much uncertainty about whether or not there's actual GPS capability on the PlayBook, being that RIM hasn't gotten GPS working on the PlayBook yet (T+2 days after launch), I thought I'd do some digging. Well, the uncertainty was that GPS location services in Poynt and Bing maps doesn't work. And there's also uncertainty as to where the Compass app got the GPS coordinates - from a tethered phone via Bluetooth, via Bridge, or via its own GPS chip. The reason GPS doesn't work in certain apps is probably the fact that they were built when there was no access to it in whatever API the app is using. Both WebWorks and the AIR SDK still don't have access to everything. RIM is still working on this. This is, by the way, a BIG part of why a lot of apps were trashed by journalists. Us developers simply weren't able to tap into all of the hardware yet. We still aren't. Therefore there's only so much a developer can do. i'm kind of annoyed with people who are saying their gps is working. don't get me wrong i'm not trying to flame anyone, i'm just trying to understand. how can we say gps is working when we have to be hooked to a wifi connection to get the gps to locate anyone. my garmin does it without a wifi connection i'm kind of annoyed with people who are saying their gps is working. don't get me wrong i'm not trying to flame anyone, i'm just trying to understand. how can we say gps is working when we have to be hooked to a wifi connection to get the gps to locate anyone. my garmin does it without a wifi connection GPS does work without internet, download the compass app, turn off the wifi, go outside and run the compass app and it will start calculating your location with greater accuracy using the GPS. Unless you're talking about offline navigation, in which case there are no offline (or even online) navigation apps available for the Playbook. Infact, I don't think that even Blackberry phones have offline GPS solutions, which is one of the biggest reasons why I won't ever buy a BB phone.

I tried it in my car with no wifi available, and it wouldn't calculate my location with the compass app. I guess if I was walking through Kansas, it might come in handy outside. LOL.. seems useless so far. JMHO.. I just look down at my feet, then look up at the sky and then look at at least three points on the horizon. I cant get my exact gps location, but with the playbook in hand and the wifi connected, bing maps seems to be working fine. I am looking forward to future updates as well. The PB doesn't have a magenometer, so I don't see how it could tell the difference of N.E.W.S., unless it was connected to wifi/tethering. I only know the Ipad2 and the Xoom to have that... But I could be wrong. Not like it's that importent to have yet. I mean for the purpose you guys ask for, sounds like you wouldn't be near wifi or without your phone to be using gps. I tried it in my car with no wifi available, and it wouldn't calculate my location with the compass app. I guess if I was walking through Kansas, it might come in handy outside. LOL.. seems useless so far. JMHO.. Just tried it by my window, WiFi off, cold start(meaning no previously downloaded GPS data) and it took about 4 mins, which is about right for an aGPS chip, to lock on to a GPS signal and start calculating my location. My phone takes the same amount of time to get a lock and calculate my location when I'm using it offline. You might have either not waited long enough, or were using it in a moving car, which can increase the amount of time it takes to get a GPS lock. Applications created using the BlackBerryr WebWorksT SDK for Tablet OS can leverage the GPS capability of the BlackBerryr PlayBookT tablet in order to retrieve current GPS coordinates. The BlackBerryr Tablet OS currently supports the following two types of GPS modes: Standalone Using an internal GPS chip, device computes a fix by communicating with satellites only Requires a clear view of the sky No data connectivity required Relatively higher Average Time To First Fix (TTFF) WLAN Geolocation Computes location based on WLAN access points Requires the device to be provisioned with this service Requires WLAN connection point be registered with RIM's Geolocation service Less accurate than standalone GPS but must faster to acquire a GPS position Note: The Tablet OS will decide to use standalone GPS coordinates if they are available, and then WLAN as a second choice.

Its main purpose is to provide items of interest to orthodox Anglicans who love the Gospel of Jesus, believe the Catholic Faith and yearn for the Church's unity. God bless you. Saturday, October 20, 2012 Here are some more gems from Henri Nouwen's meditations, \"Bread for the Journey.\" They are even more relevant today than when Nouwen penned them: BEING IN THE CHURCH AND NOT OF IT Often we hear the remark that we have live in the world without being of the world. But it may be more difficult to be in the Church without being of the Church. Being of the Church means being so preoccupied by and involved in the many ecclesial affairs and clerical \"ins and outs\" that we are no longer focused on Jesus. The Church then blinds us from what we came to see and deafens us to what we came to hear. Still, it is in the Church that Christ dwells, invites us to his table, and speaks to us words of eternal love. Being in the Church without being of it is a great spiritual challenge. LOVING THE CHURCH Loving the Church often seems close to impossible. Still, we must keep reminding ourselves that all people in the Church - whether powerful or powerless, conservative or progressive, tolerant or fanatic - belong to that long line of witnesses moving through this valley of tears, singing songs of praise and thanksgiving, listening to the voice of their Lord, and eating together from the bread that keeps multiplying as it is shared. When we remember that, we may be able to say, \"I love the Church, and I am glad to belong to it.\" Loving the Church is our sacred duty. Without a true love for the Church, we cannot live in it in joy and peace. And without a true love for the Church, we cannot call people to it. MEETING CHRIST IN THE CHURCH Loving the Church does not require romantic emotions. It requires the will to see the living Christ among his people and to love them as we want to love Christ himself. This is true not only for the \"little\" people - the poor, the oppressed, the forgotten - but also for the \"big\" people who exercise authority in the Church. To love the Church means to be willing to meet Jesus wherever we go in the Church. This love doesn't mean agreeing with or approving of everyone's ideas or behavior. On the contrary, it can call us to confront those who hide Christ from us. But whether we confront or affirm, criticize or praise, we can only become fruitful when our words and actions come from hearts that love the Church. THE AUTHORITY OF COMPASSION The Church often wounds us deeply. People with religious authority often wound us by their words, attitudes, and demands. Precisely because our religion brings us in touch with the questions of life and death, our religious sensibilities can get hurt most easily. Ministers and priests seldom fully realize how a critical remark, a gesture of rejection, or an act of impatience can be remembered for life by those to whom it is directed. There is such an enormous hunger for meaning in life, for comfort and consolation, for forgiveness and reconciliation, for restoration and healing, that anyone who has any authority in the Church should constantly be reminded that the best word to characterize religious authority is compassion. Let's keep looking at Jesus whose authority was expressed in compassion. FORGIVING THE CHURCH When we have been wounded by the Church, our temptation is to reject it. But when we reject the Church it becomes very hard for us to keep in touch with the living Christ. When we say, \"I love Jesus, but I hate the Church,\" we end up losing not only the Church but Jesus too. The challenge is to forgive the Church. This challenge is especially great because the Church seldom asks us for forgiveness, at least not officially. But the Church as an often fallible human organization needs our forgiveness, while the Church as the living Christ among us continues to offer us forgiveness. It is important to think about the Church not as \"over there\" but as a community of struggling, weak people of whom we are part and in whom we meet our Lord and Redeemer. THE GARDEN OF THE REDEEMER The Church is a very human organization but also the garden of God's grace. It is a place where great sanctity keeps blooming. Saints are people who make the living Christ visible to us in a special way. Some saints have given their lives in the service of Christ and his Church; others have spoken and written words that keep nurturing us; some have lived heroically in difficult situations; others have remained hidden in quiet lives of prayer and meditation; some were prophetic voices calling for renewal; others were spiritual strategists setting up large organizations or networks of people; some were healthy and strong; others were quite sick, and often anxious and insecure."}

I had a great long run on Saturday where I just ran for time. I needed to at least get in 20 miles and ended up running for 3:17. 7 more minutes than my goal of 3:10. The longest long run I did before Marine Corps 2008 took me about 3 hours -- so I am hoping come race day those extra 17 minutes of running will help me. I still however woke up Monday morning feel like I was completely out of shape and couldn't run a mile if you paid me to. I skipped my morning run from lack of motivation to run and push two little people. When my husband finally came home from work it took me about 2 hours to muster the energy to even get out the door for my 'easy' recovery run. Whenever feelings of self doubt creep in I try to combat them as fast as I can so they don't create a pattern of feeling that way. In order to squash my out of shape/slow feeling I putzed up to the track to run a mile and see if I was indeed out of shape or if I was just feeling sorry for myself because I was tired. 4 laps -- 1 mile -- 6:10. 6:10 is the fastest pace I have ever looked down at my watch and seen! I was so pumped that I thought to myself -- try it one more time -- see if you can get that time even lower. 1 lap -- I decided I had given it my all in that last mile and there was no way I could repeat that performance. Time to finish up my 'easy' run. All in all the miles before and the miles after that 6:10 were miserable. But I can say I'm really happy I got out there and I'm still really pleased about my mile time. Coach George sent out an email this morning containing this quote. It seemed rather fitting considering how I have felt lately. \" Marathoners wake up in the morning feeling tired and go to bed at night feeling very tired .\" -- British Olympian Brendan Foster Comments you are a crazy person -- Im sure you felt slow because you pretty much ran a marathon on Saturday, haha. I love this story Kevin told me about this basketball player who always goes out and runs 1 mile as fast as he can to make sure he's in shape. Just 1 mile, and its always sub 5! Nothing like a good time to get your spirits back up!"}

How To Cope with the Fact that There's One Less Available Prince in the World: Hopkins Style So as long as you are not living under a rock, you probably heard about the Royal Wedding this week. Unlike most people, this wedding made me sad! If you have read any of my other blogs, I aspire to marry a rich prince and this meant one more is now unavailable. To distract myself from this horrible news, I kept myself pretty busy. Friday Afternoon- After an interesting process analysis class, I met up with a Class of 1971 graduate to give him a tour of AMR II (the dorm where I live). Interestingly enough, he said it hadn't changed much in 50 years. He told me a lot about some of the old traditions at Hopkins; for example, we used to have housemasters in the AMR houses. I then went with my friend Nora to the Baltimore Museum of Art. I needed to write a French paper on an art piece and she's taken a bunch of art history classes, so we walked to the BMA and looked at some pieces. If you're an artisty person, the BMA is on campus and free to the public, so you can go look at beautiful artwork all the time. Baltimore Museum of Art I picked a piece called \"Child with A Hoop\" by Renoir. I then learned that Renoir wanted to have a girl so badly that he normally drew pictures of his son as a girl. He didn't even let his son cut his hair (despite the fact that he was teased about it). Nora and I then went to go to the Foreign Affairs Symposium where we heard from two Nobel Prize winners about their experiences. They introduced a really cool thing called \"science diplomacy\"; one of the researchers visited scientists in North Korea and Cuba and explained their peaceful exchange over their mutual love of science. After that, we were invited to go to a Battle of the a Cappella groups. Some of the groups were JHU_Lucie 's Mental Notes, JHU_Greco 's Vocal Chords, the Octopodes, Kranti (a South Asian American fusion group), and the All-Nighters. It was really fun; my favorite song of the night was \"One Semester of Spanish Love Song\" sung by the Mental Notes. After that, we headed back to the AMRs. On the way, we passed Relay for Life. For some reason, I thought that Relay for Life was a 4K run. However, Relay for Life is really awesome; people form teams and walk for 12 hours. One person from the team has to be on the track at all times. Sydney and I didn't sign up, but we decided to go for a walk anyway. A crystal-clear picture of Sydney walking with some friends Since I was so hungry from all that walking and sitting and watching and French art analysis, I decided to get one of the most delicious cupcakes that one of the booths was selling. They were true JHU_Sydney 's blog to find out more. YAY food! After that, I went with the Center for Social Concern and volunteered at the Mini Day of Service at a local farm in Baltimore. It was really fun and  the time went very quickly. I even forgot about Prince William for a while. So, it was a fun weekend! I learned that I eat a lot of cupcakes and like opening my mouth in pictures! And as my lovely roommate said, Prince Harry's cuter. Currently you have JavaScript disabled.

I'm kind of in an online relationship, within the relationship there are problems which I have stated in my previous question I asked earlier. He's 20 and I am a few years younger, although I'm legal to have sex I don't want to do anything sexual with a guy until I'm in a committed relationship. I haven't been with him for long at all and I know he will want to sleep with me when we meet up but sex scares me to be honest and I'm really not sure if I want to do anything, especially as I'm insecure about my body and we haven't sorted out the problems within our relationship. He asked me to marry him a few days ago which is crazy; I'm not ready for that kind of commitment. out of curiosity i asked him how many girls he's slept with as I want to know how much experience he has and he said \"i dunno cant remember\" so I guess he's had sex with a lot of girls which intimidates me a bit. I do care about him but I want to lose my virginity to a virgin, not someone who's had sex with a multiple of girls. Am I being mean? It makes me cringe that he's had sex with many girls and I'll be like the 46893937634th girl he's done it with, it won't be special and I'll be stuck with that memory for life. We both care about each other a lot but I just don't want to have sex with him. If I really loved him then I should sleep with him regardless of the fact that he's had sex with many girls? Best Answer - Chosen by Asker It sounds like he is moving way too fast for comfort. You are right to be cautious. You do not to have to sleep with anyone if you don't want to. It's your body. If he pressurizes you, then may I suggest that he is not the one for you. Any guy who really cares would not put you under pressure. He may well prove to be considerate - I hope so. Guys that do pressurize just want the sexual side of a relationship and then often leave after a short while to hop on to the next girl. Stop feeling like a 'victim' in this and stand up and be your own woman. I admire your restraint, and you will be a special lady in the life of the right man. Take care. Don Darkeau you've really helped me out and have led me down the right path, however, I'm going to give it time before I make a decision. Sarah and Raymond Ebare, I loved your reply, thank you. Ps a young ''PLAYER'', there are problems in our relationship so why would I accept his proposal? :s Other Answers (6) You don't have to do it with anyone you don't want to. It's you choice, just make sure he doesnt have some horrible disease though whatever you decide, sounds a little strange to me with the marriage thing. To be fair, you would probably enjoy it more with someone who has a little experience, but your wishes are your wishes and he has to respect that. Its obvious your not ready to have sex with this guy and if you do it will be a horrible experience and you won't enjoy it. So just make he knows from the get go that its not happening and if he's a gentleman he will respect you. Your not being mean at all, just honest. Source(s): D guy has been a flirt for long, so your virginity will not be anything to him. He will see as one of his sexing hours, so i will advice u loose your veginity for someone who will have value for it and respect you for it!! I was seeing an older guy as well. I wouldn't say you're being frigid at all. If you're not ready, that's up to you. As long as he's not pressuring you to do anything, you're in the clear. You shouldn't have to take it farther than you're comfortable with, and he should understand that. If he doesn't understand, he's not respecting you, and not the right guy. If youre not ready, youre just not ready! its something he should respect even if you meet in person (which is obviously an important step in your relationship.) Also his \"i dunno cant remember\" reply, probably means he is a virgin too... i honestly think that there are veeery few guys on this planet who dont know the exact amount of women theyve slept with ahah. xD If you really think hes the kind of guy who wouldnt respect your decision to not engage in anything sexual, then why are you with him? thats a huge step in anybodys life, and anyones relationship. its not something you should rush into~ every respectable girl deserves someone who respects her. (: I think he'll be more understanding then you think! and in the case then obviously hes the one with a problem. good luck with everything!~"}

I gain my knowledge of British television drama by watching as much of it as is it humanly possible to do, with the aim of eventually having seen the majority of what survives and is available. This approach is generally greeted amongst my television studies peers with a combination of admiration and trepidation -- \"I don't believe it! You have seen all eighty-eight episodes of Juliet Bravo ? Are you mad, Billy?\" The disadvantages of this methodology are more immediately apparent than the benefits. Obviously, it's very time-consuming. All eighty-eight episodes of Juliet Bravo add up to over three days of television. Watched at a rate of about five a day -- my general limit -- that still amounts to about two and a half weeks of Juliet Bravo . It's also a rather expensive pursuit. All six series of Juliet Bravo must have set me back over 75 on Amazon (although, just checking this up, I see that they've subsequently been deleted and that the sole copy of Series 6 for sale is now priced at 99.95 -- even I would balk at that level of dedication). I can never work out if I'm fortunate or cursed that my job is also my hobby. I also face the more subjective assumption that this must somehow be a pointless or soul-destroying pursuit. \"Don't you only need to watch a few episodes of Juliet Bravo to know all that you have to about it?\" From my lofty vantage point of complete Juliet Bravo viewing I find myself in an authoritative position to refute this assumption. Without watching it how else could I have discovered the eight extraordinary episodes scripted by John Foster -- who appears to have written for few other programmes -- a screenwriter preoccupied with the extremities of mental illness and danger (for example, Foster's first script, 'Rage', 25 Oct 1980, in which a disturbed mother turns up at the police station claiming to have abandoned a baby and refusing to reveal where she has hidden the child)? Or to have noticed the subtle, largely unconscious, but recurrent theme of the police being able to engage and sympathise with working class characters -- both victims and criminals -- but failing to do so with middle-class ones, often shown to make trouble for themselves through self-righteousness and lacking common sense? Or notice the shifting tone of the programme as different producers and script editors take charge? Or recognise innumerable small examples of how directorial or acting technique alters as a result of the particular demands of a specific script. Even when watching the entirety of a series means that you come across major mis-steps - such as the two misbegotten episodes written by Keith Dewhurst that attempt to transform Juliet Bravo into an absurd off-the-wall North Country comedy, or a perplexing telefantasy episode about witchcraft ('Halloween', October 27 1985) -- seeing such mistakes in the context of a programme's complete canon encouraged me to view them withmore sympathy than I would do if seen in isolation, understanding much more of the reasoning that would have gone into their commissioning and production. A concrete example of the benefit of my methodology of watching everything: As part of my work on the 'Spaces of Television' project I have presented and written about the depiction and treatment of rape storylines in British police dramas between the 1960s and the 1980s. For obvious reasons, rape was the major crime least frequently dramatized in the British police series. Attempting a rape storyline was likely to be too problematic for programme-makers to attempt, running the risk of being either too circumspect or salacious, and the nature of the crime meaning that even a responsible dramatic treatment was likely to make for depressing viewing. Because of the scarcity of rape storylines and the paucity of existing critical writing about British police series, the only way that I could discover the rare examples of when they were attempted (I've only discovered four thus far) is through systematically watching as much police drama as survives and is available. Whist it's comparatively easy to find out about who made and appeared in episodes, you really have to watch them to discover what they were about. This methodology, of watching series in their totality, has made me uneasy about how we teach undergraduate television history courses. Each week, we screen an episode (or, at most, two) taken from a series and the implications of our selection is only fully made apparent to us when we read our students' essays a couple of months later. That one episode of Z-Cars that we used because there was a recording taken from a BBC4 repeat a couple of years ago to hand in the department, is taken to represent not only all of Z-Cars , but all of 1960s police drama.

To them, the thought of women having any say in the world is sacrilege; concepts such as fulfilment, enjoyment and pleasure are to be frowned upon, and a lifetime of misery is seen as a small price to pay for an eternal afterlife. And no, I'm not only thinking of the Catholics. The eruption of protests and attacks against US embassies following the emergence of a vile anti-Islamic video (produced by a bunch of vile Americans) once more throws religious zealotry into the spotlight. If you believe much of what you read and hear, it's merely the latest case of a religion wanting to subjugate the world. Potted story? Not only should Muslims be punished for offending Muhammad but so should anyone else. Scratch the surface, however, and the affair becomes a little more complicated. I mean, yes, there's bound to be a proportion of loony Muslims out there who see all others as infidels; just as it's easy to find their Christian equivalents. You only have to consider some of the bat shit crazy Bible freaks in the US to know that. Still, to place all the recent mayhem solely at the feet of Islamic radicals is to ignore a very large elephant in the room. Of course, you won't hear Barack Obama (much less Mitt Romney) blaming anti-American sentiment for the rage and violence. But that's what it almost certainly is. Those who carried out the fatal attack on the US embassy in Libya reportedly used the anti-Islamic film protests as a cover for their operation. Demonstrators in Yemen were chanting anti-American slogans. In other non-western countries, much of the opposition was state-backed. Forget religion for a moment. Consider the US deployment of drone aircraft in countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. Controlled not by the American military but by the much less transparent CIA, the attacks have been identified as one of the main reasons for escalating anti-American sentiment in the region. Add the Israel-Palestine conflict and the ongoing US operation in west Asia, and the resentment is more understandable. Then there's the patently Islamophobic Americans who get their kicks from baiting Muslims. Nothing seems to thrill them more than producing a violent backlash, even if innocent lives are lost. According to them, it simply highlights the intolerance of Islam. Instructionally, the 14-minute video clip blamed for the most recent angst was posted to YouTube back in July. But it only gained serious traction after being promoted by US, Muslim-hating Christians. People talk about the chasm between the followers of Jesus Christ and Muhammad. Happily, there seems to be a light at the end of that particular tunnel, at least if studies in other countries are any gauge. In the UK, for example, a survey has shown that, while older people are much more prepared to embrace anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim sentiments, the younger generation is far more likely to a reject them and accept multiculturalism. Doubtless, that's a good thing. On the other hand, to blame recent uprisings around the world on solely religious differences would be to miss the point by quite some distance. Same goes for the idea the protests represent some sort of clash between those who understand the freedom of speech and those who don't. Yes, there might be elements of that but it distracts from the bigger problem: Decades of over-bearing American interference. What's fuelling this? With apologies for tampering with an election slogan, it's not the economy, stupid. And nor is it the religion. It's the politics."}

The defeat of Proposal 2, the collective bargaining ballot issue, clears the way for a possible Right to Work bill to be introduced in the Legislature. Rep. Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake and the main proponent of RTW in the Legislature, said he intends to do just that -- eventually. Right to Work prohibits the payment of union dues as a condition of employment. Workers who choose not to pay dues are still represented by union contracts. The enthusiasm by business lobbying groups to make Michigan a RTW state has picked up since neighboring Indiana earlier this year became the first Great Lakes state to adopt the measure. \"My top priority is to make Michigan the next labor freedom state,\" Shirkey said on Wednesday, hours after voters defeated Proposal 2 by a 58 percent-to-42 percent margin. But Shirkey said he faces an uphill battle because of opposition from many of his fellow lawmakers and, most significantly, from Gov. Rick Snyder. Shirkey said he would introduce a RTW bill only \"when I know for certain that I have the support of the governor.\" That support may not be forthcoming any time soon. Snyder told reporters Wednesday, as he has many times, that Right to Work legislation is not on his agenda. But he again wouldn't say whether he would veto a bill, should it reach his desk. The voter turn-down of the collective bargaining amendment is the latest in a growing line of significant public sector union defeats in recent years, including: \u0007 The resounding defeat of labor-backed Virg Bernero as the Democratic candidate for governor in 2010. \u0007 The past two years of GOP victories in Lansing on business tax cuts and pension tax increases, as well as a wide variety of anti-labor government reforms from the end of dues check-off to increased public employee concessions. Meanwhile, the labor-backed group Progress Michigan, which sponsored Proposal 2, released a survey Wednesday it said found 70 percent of Michigan voters support collective bargaining rights, including 55 percent of those who voted against Proposal 2. The poll of 500 Michigan voters was taken on Nov. 5 and 6. Zack Pohl, executive director of Progress Michigan, said the poll was conducted to show lawmakers and others that Michigan residents would likely oppose Right to Work legislation. \"Moving forward, any attempt by Lansing politicians to pass new laws that undermine (collective bargaining) would be a serious mistake,\" he said. But already on Wednesday, there was buzz among some Lansing observers and policy wonks about the possibility of \"Right to Work Lite\" -- some sort of hybrid that could seek to weaken public sector unions while exempting the private sector and also possibly exempting police unions which, to some extent, sat on the sidelines of the Prop 2 battle. Some suggested there was even the possibility of a horse trade -- support for conservatives' Right to Work legislation in exchange for moderates' gasoline tax increase to pay for road repairs; others, however, downplayed such talk. The state's leading organized voice for Right to Work legislation, the West Michigan Policy Forum, did not immediately seek to heighten the Right to Work issue Wednesday and instead chose to savor the defeat of the constitutional ballot measures. \"First we had to defeat the ballot proposals to have a shot at any of our agenda items, including such issues as transportation funding,\" said Jared Rodriguez, president of the West Michigan Policy Forum. \"Moving forward, we are committed to working on our list of priorities. All of them.\" Private-sector workers have collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act. State civil service workers have collective bargaining rights under state law. State police troopers and sergeants have had constitutionally protected collective bargaining rights since 1978. What now on home health? Voters on Tuesday also defeated Proposal 4, which would have re-instated limited collective bargaining rights to home health aides. Those rights were granted during the past administration of Gov. Jennifer Granholm, but removed by the current Legislature. Dohn Hoyle, co-chairman of Citizens for Affordable Health Care, which sponsored Proposal 4, said in a statement that \"senior and disability rights advocates across Michigan will continue our efforts to advocate for a strong registry that links home care recipients with trained home care providers who have passed criminal background checks.\" Labor-backed groups spent $31.1 million in their effort to pass Proposals 2 and 4, while business-backed groups spent $31.5 million in a successful effort to defeat them, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network. One labor expert said it would be a mistake to interpret the defeats as a sign of organized labor's declini"}

It should've come on the regular album, that's what I think. But I think this is the way and it's one of bonus tracks. Still I love the album and especially the songs I've mentioned.

I'll tell what I think about this song: Sometimes everything is like a strange land no matter how long you're there. This song I really liked me, the musical style has reminded me to keane from Hopes And Fears but it is as if mixed with the new keane of Strangeland, this is the song most sweet and sad at the same time, is very personal I think, it's like if this one song will answer that question at least I as sedentary people and I also have never traveled asks: how is to travel to tour, how is have to leave everything you know everything you have and return to see all those unknown people who do anything for you? Very beautiful song many thanks. I say that I apologize I have been very dispersed and I've seen little of km.com but not forgotten in the next few days I will be commenting on everything no matter if they are old publications I love you for everything. What I think of the song? It's utterly heart-breaking! It's an amazing piece of music! It's just something that takes me to other place! Love the lyrics and the instruments! Love you, guys!

The commissioner recently appeared before the House of Commons to discuss stronger financial penalties for privacy violations in response to what she described as the apparent disregard some social media companies are showing for Canadian privacy laws. There aren't any financial penalties for those who violate the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). \"The problem with social media companies is generally their lack of transparency with regulatory authorities,\" she said. Social media companies amass a \"staggering\" amount of personal information from Canadians, she said, and though strides have been made to protect those details, she still has concerns about how they're handled. Social media use continues to grow and plays a predominate role in our everyday lives. The commissioner's office has been trying to keep pace with the ever-changing developments within this industry. The commissioner's office has recognized that social media default settings in effect use opt-out consent for the use of personal information. On some websites, much of the personal information being shared by users, including photographs, marital status, age, and hobbies, is sensitive and should require express consent. These services often do not inform users of the extent to which their personal information may be shared through default privacy settings. Stoddart found Facebook was particularly guilty of this, although it's made some changes to improve notification of the default privacy settings to users. University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist suggests that in some respects, social media and Internet companies are the most powerful decision makers regarding privacy. He says the \"devil is in the defaults.\" The choices made by social media companies with respect to default privacy settings are the de facto privacy choices for millions of users. Stoddart says other countries are moving to more robust enforcement regimes, but Canada may fall behind and PIPEDA is too weak from an enforcement perspective. She hopes MPs will enact greater enforcement powers and greater accountability standards for companies within PIPEDA. Stoddart said with barely any penalties for breaching its provisions, there is little incentive for companies to invest in better data protection. She feels if there were stricter penalties for companies that would affect their bottom line, they would be more inclined to adhere to the privacy laws. Questions to ponder include: Would the ability to collect financial penalties for PIPEDA violations make a difference? Does the newness of social media products make it inherently difficult to get privacy right? Does the complexity of social media products make it inherently difficult to create clear and simple privacy policies and choices? Given pressure to generate revenue, do social media companies tend to set default choices to favour greater use of user data over privacy? Do some social media companies just not put enough thought into privacy issues upfront? David Canton is a business lawyer and trade-mark agent with a technology focus at Harrison Pensa LLP.

Click the image to see the serpent, top right. Photograph: Neil Denny I've talked to a number of theoretical physicists during my tour of America , and often the subject of parallel universes has come up. This week I actually got to visit one, when I spent a disorientating afternoon in Petersburg, Kentucky, at the Creation Museum . The Creation Museum bills itself as a natural history museum, but it's one from a world in which we are certain that God created the Earth and everything in it, roughly 6,000 years ago, and all in six days. Anything that looks older -- fossilised dinosaur bones, multiple strata of sedimentary rock, signs of ancient water erosion and the moving of the continents -- were all caused by one catastrophic event, the flood that Noah and his family so adroitly survived by building a massive floating menagerie. This is nothing you wouldn't see or hear in your average fundamentalist church, but what makes the Creation Museum different, and controversial, is that it promotes the idea that not only is everything stated in Genesis chapters 1-11 true, but it can be proved ... with science. And the museum has teams of qualified palaeontologists, geologists, biologists and historians working on this. Oh, and baraminologists too. You haven't heard of them? Neither had I. For anyone not familiar with the early parts of the Bible, these be the facts: God created everything in six 24-hour days; Adam and Eve were the first humans; all the bad stuff in the world, from murder to animals eating other animals, is a result of Eve's choice of afternoon snack; Noah built an ark to house two of every kind of land-dwelling animal (including dinosaurs) and his extended family, while God wiped everything clean with a worldwide flood; then God linguistically confused Noah's descendants and dispersed them around the world with the Tower of Babel incident. The Creation Museum was founded by the organisation Answers in Genesis , led by the Australian fundamentalist Ken Ham. It first opened in May 2007, and on the day I was visiting it was celebrating its 5th anniversary. In those five years over a million people have been through its doors, many, if my visit was anything to go by, on school trips. The site is huge, housing both the museum and the headquarters of Answers in Genesis, and provides employment for over 300 people. The museum is entirely privately funded. Despite the erroneous claim to be a natural history museum, the displays of fossils , including casts of many famous examples such as an archaeopteryx and Lucy the Australopithecine soon give way to expensively mounted dioramas telling the biblical story of creation. There's also a section where a world that has abandoned God is depicted -- picture a Disneyfied crack den where vulnerable teenagers watch porn and consider abortions. Any actual attempts to present \"science\" inevitably have a creationist slant. A display on evolution suggests that \"Although often viewed as an icon of evolution, Darwin's finches serve as a perfect model of variation within a created kind [because in] Genesis 1:21 we learn that God created 'every winged bird according to its kind'.\" Those baraminologists interpret \"kind\" to mean \"species\". While at the museum I spent some time talking to geologist Andrew Snelling. Another Australian, Snelling has a PhD in geology from the University of Sydney and worked in various capacities for the Australian mining industry before getting into \"creation science\" full time, first for the Texas-based Institute for Creation Research, and then since 2007 for Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum. I mention to Andrew that I'm surprised to see animatronic models and fossils of dinosaurs around the museum. \"They were real, we have their bones ... in fact the Bible even potentially describes creatures that were dinosaurs. We don't have to be afraid of the real evidence,\" he says. \"We're looking at the fossil record -- instead of being the order of creatures living and dying and evolving over millions of years -- as the burial order during the flood. In other words, dinosaurs were alive during the pre-flood Earth. So were trilobites, so were people.\" When I ask him how his background in geology is being used here, he tells me of his fieldwork at the Grand Canyon. \"In my research I've been involved in sampling rocks, sending them to laboratories, where analysis is done on radio isotopes,\" he says. \"What we always emphasise is this: we all have the same rocks, the same fossils, the same evidence ... We all have the same geological maps ... As we emphasise in the museum it's your starting point.\" This is a point that's made over and over, to the extent that it begins to sound reasonable. Their mantra is, \"Hey, we're all doing science here, there's just a disagreement about the age.\" Creation science has a big problem with orthodox radiometric dating and carbon dating. They al"}

I'm literally besieged by emails offering cheap links. I can grab 100 one-way PR 4 links for $200 or less. I can also buy links from this or that domain hoarder who is happy to make a quick deal with me. I can participate in \"safe\" link networks where I'm assured that I will see an amazing increase in my rankings and traffic. These are not authority links. Authority links aren't easy to get. They are not $200 for 100 of them, I can assure you. So where are these elusive authorities, how do you identify them and, most importantly, how do you go about snagging a link from one of them? What Is An Authority Site? Let's start by defining what an authority site is not. It's not always the top result in Google. It's not always even found on the first page, depending upon the day and the latest algorithmic changes. Certain niches tend to be spammier, too, with the top results being utter trash. As SEOs, we know not to immediately trust the \"best\" results that are served up. But what about your average small business owner or, as I like to say, what about my mom? Bless her heart. If my mom were looking for the best hotel in Pigeon Forge, she'd book the first result she found, then fuss at me for its craptastic bed and lack of closeness to a McDonalds. I run the Internet, to her. Think about gossip. If you hear something, you generally do consider the source. If your friend Karly is known for spreading false information and she tells you that your other friend Jamie just got fired, you probably won't immediately leave Jamie a message that says \"I'm so sorry you got fired!\" right? You'd either ask Jamie or, if he couldn't be reached, you'd ask Jamie's roommate as he always knows what's going on with Jamie. An authority site is just like a person that can be trusted to give you what you're looking for. Sometimes you get lucky with a search and the first results are true authorities. But generally speaking, using placement as a defining way to identify an authority can seriously backfire, especially when there's a lot of volatility in the SERPs. Let's now look at a truly amazing authoritative site that I can personally vouch for so that we can dig into what does make an authority: BackyardChickens.com . I have no association with them at all. My husband asked one question in the forum (our \"hen\" suddenly began crowing last year...poor little Pearl was actually Mr. Pearl and had to be rehomed) but other than that, my involvement with the site has been limited to reading the forums, looking at coop plans, and reading articles. I've never actually done research before getting a certain type of animal but I thought I should with chickens, and this site came up every single time I did any chicken-related search. As of this moment, they have 148,622 members. Every time I check back, that number has increased. What makes this site an authority is the fact that it ranks for just about everything related to raising chickens in your backyard, and it doesn't do this through keyword stuffing or clever file paths, it does it through the collective knowledge of its users. It's just a really, really good site, period. You instinctively know that you can trust the information here. It's good enough for its 148,622 members, which is good enough for me. Past vs. Current Ways to Identify an Authority Site Back in the day, you could usually depend on top listings to be authorities. However, that's when we started to manipulate the web in various ways. In 2004 I could rank just about any site that I worked on through cloaking, for example. Given a truly poor site that was not user-friendly, was full of nothing but boring product descriptions, and wasn't one I'd ever buy a thing from, I could help them easily make money. Today, it's much harder as there have are frequent algorithm updates that are designed to combat the latest overused technique, sometimes completely screwing up and accidentally pushing decent sites further down into the results pages. Some people still rely on metrics such as Google's Toolbar PageRank or MozRank to determine a site's authority, but it's simply too easy to employ methods that mean most metrics are about as reliable as Alexa. These days we have social signals to consider, which can be manipulated too of course, but genuine user engagement through social media channels and the site itself is discernible if you take the time to check it out. You have to work harder than you did years ago, because now, you can't just trust that someone with 15,000 Twitter followers has legitimately gained those followers by being an authority. You may find a post that has 500 tweets and zero comments, and when you dig into who tweeted the post, you'll see that they're mostly automated spam accounts. Today, as much as I hate to say it, you simply can't rely on any metrics to iden"}

Why write it now? Too much material. It comes largely from some of the stuff I've been writing in the newspaper column [ in The Guardian ] over the past nine years. Some are things I've learned about from some of the Ig Nobel winners. Some of the winners have really become part of the family. From them and from other people, every day there's a big flow of information and commentary. I'm always looking for stuff and trawling around, but some days the flow becomes, I say this cheerfully, almost overwhelming in volume. How did you get into this business in the first place? I used to be doing software stuff. I started a software company. But I've always done stuff a little bit like this, even when I was a little kid. This chunk of my career, life, whatever, started when I wondered whether some of this stuff that I'd been writing, whether I might get it published somewhere. I sent a little pile of it off to a magazine [ The Journal of Irreproducible Results ]. I got a phone call from somebody saying, I got your articles, and I was wondering if you'd like to be the editor of the journal. You'd sent them in blind? I hadn't even seen a copy of the magazine. It was an old magazine. It turned out to have a long, really tangled, crazy history. It started with a couple of scientists in Israel in the 1950s. But by the time I got to it, it was in such bad shape that anybody could improve it. So I found the original guys, a couple more, and we started the Ig Nobel ceremonies. All kinds of good things started happening. Then the company publishing it got a new president who decided he wanted to kill off a lot of their publications. So after a few years, rather than watching the thing disappear, I invited everyone who'd ever been involved to start a new thing, with a new name. And the guy who came up with the name of the original, I made sure he got to name the new one. In the early days, how did you find the studies you covered? There was still a bunch of people who knew of the previous journal. There was a gang of people who had been doing this stuff and had no place to send it. As time went on it became easier and easier. There's so much stuff out there. So much stuff. And some of it has this quality we look for: it makes you laugh, and then makes you think. It sticks in your head. And a week later it's all you want to talk about. How do you choose the research that features in The Annals of Improbable Research ? With great difficulty. I could live off the pile I have now for 10 or 20 years. But it also means that as time goes on I get to be choosier and choosier. The Ig Nobel prizes at this point have 9000 new nominations per year, and 10 winners. And pretty consistently, 10 to 20 per cent is people nominating their own stuff. Those almost never win. The funny thing about the Ig Nobel prize is that quality is almost always a side effect. It's difficult to hit that quality if that's the main thing you're trying to do. Often there's something that strikes you as amusing, and it is. But when you go and talk to the person who did it, you realise that this conversation you're having is the first time they've realised they did something funny. Can you give me an example of that? The physics prize one year went to a group of scientists in Australia. They had published a paper titled: \"An analysis of the forces required to drag sheep across various surfaces.\" [Laughs] Almost everyone in the world reacts exactly like you did. But these people, it's just what they were doing. They live in a part of Australia where sheep was a major industry. The people who work with sheep have to bring thousands of them through a big building to shear them. It's a complicated and dangerous process, the sheep often don't want to move where you want them to when you want them to. There were a lot of injuries to the people who use the equipment, as well as the sheep. The managers were always looking for ways to make it happen more smoothly and less dangerously. So they called in these scientists and asked, is there anything you can do? The scientists went to work, and this was their report. But the moment it was pointed out, they immediately thought it was funny. Now that the Igs are 20 or so years old, they're kind of venerable and respected. How does that make you feel? I hope it's not too well respected. I wish it were better known. If you were to go out on the street, probably even right here in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and asked the first person you met if they know what the Ig Nobel prize is, most people don't know. In the last few years I've really come to believe that if this were happening in another country, it would be better known. There's always so much more interest in England and in other countries than here. Someone I was on a panel with about a year ago put into words what's different about how science is treated in the US: science here is earnest. It's important, "}

Answered by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari Question: It has been mentioned previously on the Hanafi Fiqh List that the wife must obey the husband even in reasonable permitted household matters like cooking. But Shaykh Muhammad ibn Adam mentioned that there is another opinion on the issue. Can you explain? Answer: In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, This is a very sensitive and controversial subject which affects no doubt many people. I will attempt to (Insha Allah) elaborate on it from a Hanafi perspective. Let us first look and study the texts of the traditional Hanafi Fuqaha (Jurists), mentioned in their respective books. Imam al-Kasani states in his Bada'i al-Sana'i: \"If the husband brings food that needs to be cooked, then the wife should cook it, due to the narration that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) distributed the labour between Siyyiduna Ali and Sayyidatuna Fatimah (Allah be pleased with them). The work outside the home was the responsibility of Ali (Allah be pleased with him)), where as the household work was the domain of Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her). However, the wife will not be compelled or forced to cook, and the husband will be obliged to bring her cooked food if she demands. If the husband wished to acquire her services for cooking in return for payment, then this is not permissible, neither is it lawful for her to take this money. If she does so, she will be taking money on something that is necessary (Wajib) on her according to the preferred opinion (Fatwa), thus it will akin to taking a bribe. The great Faqeeh (Jurist) Abu al-Laith said: \"This is when the wife is unable to cook, or she is from a dignified family. If she is able to cook or she is from those who normally carry out their own jobs, then she will be compelled to do so\". (Kasani, Bada'i al-Sana'i , 4/24). Imam al-Mawsuli stated in al-Ikhtiyar : \"The wife will not be compelled and forced to cook if she refuses to do so, and the husband will be obliged to bring someone who will cook, as it is necessary (Wajib) upon the husband to provide food. They ( Fuqaha) said: \"This is when she is not capable of cooking or she is from a upper-class family. However, if she is able to cook or from a family who normally carry out their jobs themselves, she will be forced, because she is considered (in this case) an obstinate\" (Abd Allah ibn Mahmud al-Mawsili, al-Ikhtiyar li Ta'lil al-Mukhtar, 3/225). And in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya: \"If she (wife) says: \"I will not cook\", it is stated in 'al-Kitab': She will not be forced to do so and the husband will be obliged to bring her prepared made food or someone who will cook for her. Abu al-Laith said: \" This (oblige ness of the husband bringing her food....) is when she is from a upper-class family who normally do not perform the household jobs themselves, or she is not from a upper-class family, but she is  incapable of cooking due to some illness or weakness. They (Fuqaha) said: \"These (household) jobs are her religious duties, although the Qadhi can not force her. This has also been mentioned in al-Bahr al-Raiq\". (al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, 1/548). It is stated in Hashiyah of Tahtawi on the Durr of al-Haskafi: \"These acts are her necessary religious duties in a sense that a Qadi can not force her to carry them out\". (3/255). And finally it is stated by Imam al-Haskafi in his Durr al-Mukhtar : \"If the wife refused to cook and grind, if she is from those who normally don't perform their own jobs or she is incapable, then the husband will be obliged to bring her cooked food. However, if she performs her works by her self or she is capable, it will not be necessary for the husband to do so. It is also impermissible for the wife to take any pay or salary in return for her cooking, as this is religiously necessary upon her even if she be from a respectable family, since the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him & give him peace) divided the labour between Ali and Fatimah (Allah be pleased with them both) with the outside work being the responsibility of Ali, and the household work of Fatimah, even though she was the master/ leader of all the women of the world\". Ibn Abidin, the great Hanafi Faqih, whilst commentating on this, says in his 'Hashiyah': \"Regarding al-Haskafi's statement \"it will not be necessary for the husband to do so\", it is said that she will be forced (to cook). Imam Sarakhsi said: \"she will not be forced, but if she does not cook, then the husband will not give her any curry, and this is correct. Regarding the statement \"This is her religious duty\", this is the Fatwa we give, but she won't be forced if she refuses. (Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 3/579). \"It is not a legal obligation of the wife, according to Islamic teachings, to cook the meals or serve the house, and if a woman elects to refuse to undertake these works, a husband cannot compel her to do so\" It is true that from a pure legal poin"}

If you've missed any of the tutorials, you may want to look at the index , and start from the beginning. Hello! This is the first of a series of articles aimed at teaching basic web publishing techniques to new content developers. Webmastering 101 won't teach you how to write advanced Java applets, or the intricacies of HTML. It will, however, guide you through the process of creating your first web site, and towards the goal of becoming a confident webmaster, who can use the world-wide-web to publish content and information. So you want to be a webmaster? Many people have the ambition of becoming a webmaster (either as a profession, or for their own personal or commercial site). Its becoming a popular goal, as more and more people learn about the web, and how easy it is to create their own web pages. Authors, hobbyists, journalists, business people, and even individuals can all gain from becoming competent at publishing information on the web. If you're not sure, then see if any of the following reasons fit you. Self-promotion (career or social life) Status symbol (hey - check out my web page) Selling a product or service Sharing information about a hobby or a skill with like minded people Promotion of a new way of thinking, or ideology Advancing a charity or cause Creating awareness in the community about a topic Learning a publishing skills as a hobby, or as a profession This list is not exhaustive; there are thousands of good reasons why you should learn web publishing and thousands of ways in which you can benefit from the experience. Some people have an unfulfilled creative urge to develop content for others, and some people just want to develop new skills which may help them in their career. TIP - Each lesson will contain a series of tasks. They're not very hard, so give them ago. Attempting them will make it easier to learn web publishing, because you'll be actively participating, and not just passively reading. Task One - Write on a new sheet of paper two or three reasons why you would like to learn how to create web pages. File this sheet of paper away, and see if you have meet the objectives by the end of these lessons. What does a webmaster do? The title webmaster is claimed by so many, that its difficult to actually quantify what makes a webmaster. Some people create a homepage, describing their hobbies and interests - does this make them a webmaster? Some people create massive sites, with tens or even hundreds of pages, so should it be reserved for the professionals? My definition of a webmaster is simple - one who creates or maintains a web site. A web site is not a single page, it is a collection of pages that are linked together in much the same way a spiderweb contains links that form part of a larger work of art. If you create, or maintain, a web site that deals with multiple pages, then you are a webmaster! As with any title or job, however, there are good webmasters and bad webmasters. So how can I become a good webmaster? Just keep reading! In future lessons, we'll learn the techniques that a good webmaster needs, and the tools which a good webmaster should use. However, there is are some important steps you can take to improve your skills - the most important being practice. Putting the skills learned here into use is important, and most lessons will require you to put in some time applying the techniques to actual web pages. For the moment, however, we'll take a look at some \"good\" sites, which demonstrate good webmastering skills, and a \"bad\" site, which demonstrates undesirable techniques. The good, the bad and the ugly I'm sure that you've come across sites before which you thought were fantastic, and some that you'd never want to visit again. As with anything creative, what looks \"good\" to one eye may look bad to another. However, on the web this problem is magnified. People don't all have the same type of computer, and they don't all use the latest browser. They don't all have the latest plugins installed, so a good site will look good no matter what type of computer or browser is being used. For this lesson, we're going to look at sites which have been ranked highly by human reviewers. Lycos maintains a human review system, and lists the top 5% of sites. Take a look at some of the sites that its reviewers believe are the best of the web. Lycos groups them into categories, so you should pick several different categories. Task Two - Select three (3) categories from the Lycos Top 5% of the Web collection.

I thought at the time it was a bit odd they couldn't find the resources to publish the analysis of the consultation responses before the decision was made, but I wasn't sure what to make of it. The consultation responses showed a big majority in favour of a single question, so the Scottish Government could never have used them to put a second question on the ballot paper. In other words, if the Scottish government had released the responses a month ago, the UK government would have realised there was no danger that the Scottish government would actually put a second question on the ballot paper, and they would have asked for something else instead in the negotiations. So by delaying the release of the responses to the consultation until after the Edinburgh Agreement had been signed, the Scottish government managed to get everything they wanted themselves, as well as what the Scottish public asked for in the consultation."}

The current National Government are keeping the lines of jobless New Zealanders long by choice. Their decisions to cut Government spending in a recession, neglect tertiary educational and skills opportunities (like Christchurch's rebuild) and pursue purist monetarism are having a real impact in the market for jobs. Blaming the recession is not enough, even Fran O'Sullivan admits that. However, I'm not sure another summit is the solution. It's time for real change. I have friends who have been out of work since 2009. For those who haven't bought a one-way ticket to Australia, their prospects of finding a job at home are bleak. It's not as if they're stupid, unkempt or without experience. Some have Masters and Honours degrees. It's just that National doesn't work for those who want to work. National's policies are designed to keep inflation low, taxes down and capital values intact. It's a liberal-conservative party. You'd expect that. The question for Labour going into Conference 2012 is whether those are our priorities, too. For much of the Fifth Labour Government, they were. Undoubtedly unemployment would have been lower had Labour stayed in office. But by how much? Perhaps these shocking unemployment figures are a chance for reflection. Perhaps we're ready to be bold, again. Labour MPs have called many things a 'crisis' over the last few months. The fact that there is a quarter of our young people desperate for work is a crisis. Especially while our resident Australian-owned banks post their biggest profits ever. Why? It's because these two record highs illustrate the massive gulf between the real economy and the financial economy. While the banks are still fuelling a housing bidding war, diverting precious capital, manufacturers are waiting for exchange rate parity with the US to come any day now, killing more jobs up and down the country. We can't rely on this Government to lead the creation of jobs either. Cycleways, financial hubs and other bright ideas have fallen by the wayside. For 25% of my generation, the only cycle they'll be riding is to the WINZ office. That same 25% will not know the experience of going to work, of creating things, of building relationships on the job or joining a union. Who knows how long they'll be searching for work. That 25% represents a lost generation. If this situation is a crisis, which Labour firmly believes it is, then surely that calls for a bold response -- adequate enough to fix the crisis and place the affected group in a stronger position going forward? Is David Shearer's 'Hands-On Government' that response? Let's hope so. Trouble is, Shearer has already restricted his response to not including \"big government and spending more\". While some tools for job recovery and those other crises (housing, child poverty, singular internet cables) like monetary policy reform, don't require too much cash money, others will test Third Way elements of the Labour Party. For example: Are we ready to build 50,000 state houses every year? How about real stimulus spending to increase economic productivity through infrastructure and skills? Or lifting benefits to livable levels? Are we ready to truly guarantee every young person the opportunity of training, education and employment? Are we ready to put our money where our mouth is? If we want to find the lost generation, it'll require a bold response to what we've labeled as a crisis. Rhetoric isn't enough. I think we can do it. But it will mean moving beyond the Clark years. Beyond 1984."}

Those of us who work in employment law have already had to take on board the following changes: (as of this April) the doubling of the period during which an employee needs to be continuously employed in order to bring an unfair dismissal claim, the doubling of the amount of costs an Employment Judge can order without needing to refer the case to the county court, and the phasing out of lay panellists in all cases save discrimination. In June, the government published its Employment and Regulatory Reform Bill, which in due course will mean \"protected conversations\", under which managers will be empowered to force workers -- ostensibly by consent -- out of their jobs, save that Employment Judges will be banned from asking what was said by each side in the dismissal meetings (which will have taken place directly between manager and worker with no lawyer present) by privilege rules akin to the privilege a lawyer has with her lay client. From next April, employment lawyers will contend with changes to public funding, with legal help being removed from all categories of claim save discrimination cases. The government has also announced that from next summer, there will be for the first time fees for issuing Tribunal claims. The fees, at up to 1500, are far higher than the equivalent fees in the county court. To crown the injustice, the fees are to be paid by workers only, with employers paying nothing. Any readers pausing at this point to draw breath may realise that they have only reached the starting point of the government's plans. For in the middle of September, the government introduced a further three consultations, covering matters as diverse as workers' rights on transfers of employment (which the government belatedly admits it cannot diminish, as the source of the law is European rather than domestic), Tribunal procedure, settlement and compensation. The most significant change to the procedural rules is a new power that a Judge can strike out a claim at any stage in the process. Gone will be the old fashioned Case Management Discussions, slow, civilised hearings at which the Judge grapples with what the case is about and lists it accordingly. In place of them, every hearing will be what we now call Pre-Hearing Reviews, i.e. hearings, with or without evidence, where the employer jockeys (rarely with success, where the worker is represented) to have the entire claim dismissed with no further hearings. This \"reform\" is a government concession to the employer's lobby, with its bogus argument that the majority of Tribunal claims are vexatious (in fact 60% succeed, and only 0.5% are so unreasonable as to attract costs). Settlement, the government proposes to encourage by introducing a new rule that cases may not be brought until the worker has submitted the claim first to the conciliation service Acas and received back from Acas a certificate that the claim has been lodged with them for a period of time without being settled. It is envisaged that a certain amount of information will be needed to be given to Acas (although what that information will be, the government has not decided), and that Acas will be able to refuse to accept some claims, but there has been no real thinking about what would happen to time limits, eg if the refusal had been misguided. As an inevitable by-product, this will mean that the limitation periods for introducing tribunal claims which are presently relatively simple (3 months but the time can be extended, in certain exceptional circumstances) will become very complex indeed. It will be rich pickings for respondent lawyers, who will raise time defences in very many cases, but of no benefits to claimants or even to Judges (who face lengthy, complex hearings on issues far from the real subject of the case). Finally, changes to the maximum compensatory award that can be made for unfair dismissal, will reduce the top award from its present c72,000 to a future c26,000. Only a minority of dismissal claimants are in fact awarded more than 26k, but this in part because the highest value claims with the most extraordinary facts, inevitably settle. The workers in this category will have the same complaints, and the cases will have the same outcome (employers will be desperate to keep their bad facts away from the Tribunal), the chief difference is that managers who behave badly will be able to get rid of these cases by throwing less money at them."}

Forever alongside Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's 'go to men', the duo have represented the red side of Merseyside with myriad devotion and ardour; but the end is looming. Gerrard's captaincy may just propel him on for a few more seasons, although its Carra's career that looks to be reaching an unsavoury diminuendo. Having played under more managers than he has scored goals for Liverpool, you start to contemplate how much more is left in the grand old legs of Jamie Carragher. Next month sees Carra reach his 16th year of being a red and, unfortunately, it looks year number 17 is just out of his grasp but, since his Liverpool inauguration in October 1996, Carra's 705 outings for the Reds have exemplified himself, the city and pertinently, the club: spirited, resolute and assiduous. The Rodgers era's zephyr has swept through Anfield, enclosing flurries of a new continental approach, a new philosophy, a new Liverpool; though an Anfield veteran of six managers, you query Carragher's ability to integrate into this new slant with as much gusto and diligence as he has the rest. His rugged and no nonsense defending seems inapt in Brendan Rodgers' convalescing tiki-taka style, more or less rendering Jamie inadequate when measured up to the likes of Daniel Agger and Martin Skrtel who seem to be the inclined duo centre back, and in a world where stylish defending is of the essence, Carra becomes a square peg in a round hole. As much as his traditional defending manner seems unsuited to Rodgers' possession approach, Carra has 16 years of first class football behind him -- a wealth of experience to invoke to try and acclimatize. With trepidation though, I believe Carragher's days are well and truly numbered. It's sad. It's almost painful to read the Liverpool team sheet every week; virtually anticipating the dearth of our faithful servant in the starting XI. Nevertheless, there may well be more Liverpool left in Jamie Carragher -- management. Perched on the bench for many a time thus far under Rodgers, observing the Irishman's conduct could do Carra a remarkable amount of good. His philosophy offers an illustration of where modern football is going and should Carragher delve into the world of coaching in the future, Rodgers would present a great insight into life as a young coach. So, as Carragher's iridescent footballing candle starts to douse, it's time to call a spade a spade. Carragher's vigorous Liverpool journey is reaching a humble finale but we won't be without our doting memories. Nonetheless, from the quenched embers, could come a bespoke leader -- one filled with immense pride, overflowing with footballing astuteness and incredible prosperity. One ready to pilot his treasured club and its adoring fans back to where they dearly belong. One ready to paradigm the youth as he has with great dignity for many years. The least said about the tactically- and technically-inept Jamie Hoofer Carragher the better. One wonders why he chose to play professional football when he is so frigging uncomfortable with a football at his feet."}

Opportunity to take a step back and think strategically about how infrastructure can best support economic growth and make our communities stronger in the future. Overview of the Engagement Process The engagement process is proceeding in three overlapping components: Taking Stock Highlighting Investment Benefits Before looking forward, it's important to take stock of past investments First publication released during launch of the long-term plan engagement process on November 30 th : Modern and efficient public infrastructure is key to supporting Canada's most important economic and environmental goals and to building strong and prosperous communities. The ability of public infrastructure to support and adapt to changes, trends and interactions across economic, environmental, and community dimensions is a key concern. Working Together All levels of government recognize the importance of sound public infrastructure and the contribution it makes to a stronger economy, an improved quality of life and a cleaner environment. Provincial, territorial and municipal governments play a leading role in planning, developing, building, operating and maintaining most public infrastructure in Canada. Canada has over one million kilometres of two-lane equivalent roads, including an interconnected system of national highways: In 2011, $149 billion worth of exports and $162 billion worth of imports were transported by road between Canada and the United States; this represents 56% of trade between the two countries or 35% of Canada's total world trade. Broad benefits linked to significant highway investments by all orders of government: Since 2006, over 2,600 km of the NHS has been improved (or 12% of its total length), upgrading their pavement condition rating to \"good\" . Since 2007, 700 of the 8,700 bridges that are part of the NHS are now either new or have undergone major rehabilitation. Average age of roads in Canada is significantly lower than a decade ago, from 17 years in 2000 to 13 years in 2010. From 2007 to 2009, Canadian authorities recorded a significant decrease of 20% (from 2,761 to 2,209) in road collision fatalities, their lowest level in almost six decades. Wastewater: Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Watershed This watershed has been a key priority for federal government infrastructure: One of the largest water systems in the world - drains more than  of the Earth's freshwater reserves. Millions of Canadians rely on it for drinking water, employment, tourism and recreation, transportation, and trade (more than 180 million metric tons of cargo travels the St. Lawrence every year, bringing goods to and from North America). In 1972 the Canada- U.S. Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was signed making a commitment to restore and maintain the health of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. 17 Areas of Concern or \"hotspots\" were identified in Canada The Government of Canada has committed over $274 million to wastewater projects in Areas of Concern through a number of its programs. Since 2007 Canada has committed over $1 billion to more than 700 wastewater projects in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence water system and an additional $350 million has been committed to wastewater infrastructure projects through the Gas Tax Fund. Identifying Knowledge Priorities Working with partners and stakeholders, as well as with technical experts and academics to examine and build our knowledge around five themes: We are building the technical and policy knowledge to inform the development of a long-term plan by: undertaking new research and creating an on-line reference centre for existing infrastructure studies; leading a steering committee to guide knowledge-building --  The Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the Canadian Association of Municipal Administrators sit on this committee. Infrastructure and the Economy Understanding how infrastructure investment supports economic growth and ensuring that Canada's infrastructure sector has the right skills and workforce to meet future demand.

Share Mass Effect 2 was an incredible experience. We're certain that it will have a fair share of 'game of the year' awards when gaming outlets start dishing them out later this month. Bioware's sci-fi role-playing franchise has gone from strength to strength; while the first game had its fair share of flaws overall it was an incredibly exceptional game that breathed new life and character into an overused and somewhat clichd genre. Mass Effect 2 built on the strengths of the first game and streamlined the RPG elements of the game, allowing players to focus more on the unique characters, their relationships and ultimately on deciding their fate. It's no wonder then that expectations for Mass Effect 3 are astronomical and judging from the trailer released late last week, we're pretty sure that Bioware is acutely aware of that fact. The short but oh so sweet trailer for Mass Effect 3 concluded with Shepard turning away from a burning planet Earth relying on him to be its savour with a quiet, confident and determined resolve. We can't help but feel Shepard's demeanour reflects Bioware's attitude. We're pretty sure BioWare will do a bang up job with ME3, but that won't stop us from putting together a list of things that we want to see in the final chapter of the Mass Effect trilogy. MASS LEGACY We're not sure how it went down in your campaigns, but a fair few of us spent hours and hours developing our Shepard so that we'd be able to discharge the infamous 'Wrex' moment without losing one of the games coolest characters. And we were mighty proud when we managed to pull it off. Imagine our disappointment then when we learned that you could only make use of the data import feature in Mass Effect 2 if you had a completed save game that didn't have a new career started on it, followed by the crushing realisation that the game assumed that (spoilers!) Wrex was dead. We're not sure if there's a way to suggest he lived in the conversation with Miranda at the start but as you can imagine we're not too keen on starting a new campaign just to find out, at the risk of botching another opportunity to carry our game into ME3. Hopefully Mass Effect 3 will be a little more forgiving on its requirements, but not just that, we'd like to see our actions in Mass Effect 2 have more of an impact in the next game both in terms of the story and world as well as the character development. DLC such as Shadow Broker suggests that ME3 will be far more in touch with Shepard's history and the state of the universe as he left it in Mass Effect 2, and after the events of Shadow Broker, we can't wait to see what happens next. MASS LORE MASTER This one is short and simple. We love learning about the Mass Effect universe, the lore on different species, institutions, cities and events fascinates us. We also like playing the game, what we don't like is picking between doing one or the other. We'd like to see BioWare take a page out of the BioShock/Batman school of information delivery and allow us to listen to the information provided in the Codex in the background while playing the game at the same time. We'd be far more inclined to explore the numerous info packets if we didn't have to stare at a menu to do so, it affects the pace of the game and pulls us out of the experience. Recommended Links From The Web Comments Major things Id like to see? Ideally, Id like to see Liara, Ashley/Kaidan and Wrex return as squadmates. At the VERY LEAST I want to see Liara and Ashley/Kaidan return as squadmates, since those two characters (depending on who lived on virmire) are alive in EVERYONES games. Wrex and everyone else can be dead, but there are at least two GUARANTEED survivors. That IMO means they deserve more than a crappy cameo, more than a big support character role completely detached from the action, but a return to fighting with Shepard against the reapers. The others I could understand filling more sideline roles since they are all potentially dead, but those two characters are most important for me. Another thing, one of the most important is to see them stop with the crappy shooter mission setup. The articificial shooting gallery missions complete with stupid mission complete screen pretty much ruined ME2 for me. The ENTIRE game felt so segmented it hurt. I want to see a return to the more typical \"big mission\" style from Bioware that they used in KOTOR or Mass Effect. Where visiting a world was an IMPORTANT thing, and lasted a good couple of hours sometimes. It felt much more connected, involved and all round better developed than just skipping from one short shooter mission to the next. I want to see Bioware get back to that formula, since its much more satisfying and gives off much bigger pieces of the story than the silly little shooting gallery mission system in ME2. Bit more RPG in combat would be nice, like the article says, but they dont need to go overboard with"}

Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip early Saturday destroyed the Hamas Cabinet headquarters. The strikes followed an exchange of rocket fire Friday between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza with one Palestinian rocket landing in a field outside Jerusalem. Hamas claimed responsibility for the unprecedented attack on the holy city. Israel responded by calling up thousands more military reserves for a potential force of 75,000 reservists. Palestinian officials say 38 people have died in Gaza since the Israelis began the airstrikes earlier in the week. Three Israelis are reported to have been killed by Hamas rockets. Mr. Kandil said Egypt \"will make sacrifices and every effort to achieve a truce.\" In Cairo, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi called the Israeli assault a \"blatant aggression against humanity.\" U.S. President Barack Obama telephoned the Egyptian president Friday to discuss the situation. Mr. Obama also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who thanked the U.S. for helping Israel develop a missile defense system that he says has knocked out hundreds of rockets, saving Israeli lives. An Israeli missile Wednesday killed the top military commander of Hamas in Gaza. Israel says the killing was in direct response to the almost daily rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza. Hamas vowed revenge and warned that Israel had opened up what it calls \"the gates of hell.\" Egyptian officials say a speeding train has collided with a school bus, killing at least 49 people. Almost all of them were young children. Officials say the accident occurred Saturday about 300 kilometers south of Cairo near the village of Manfalut in Egypt's southern Assiut province. The bus was filled with more than 60 children between the ages of four and six when it was hit by a train while crossing the tracks. Officials say that along with the 49 deaths, another 18 people were injured. The provincial governor says the railway crossing gate was open when the train hit the bus, and that the crossing worker was asleep at the time. He has been detained. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says now that the war in Iraq is over for the U.S. military and the war in Afghanistan is winding down, America is seeking to promote its economic interests around the world. The country's top diplomat, speaking Saturday in Singapore, sought to dispel concern over a looming so-called \"fiscal cliff\" of tax hikes and budget cuts in the U.S. pitting President Barack Obama against Republican opponents in Congress. Republicans and Democrats emerged from a meeting with the president Friday pledging to find common ground to avert a financial catastrophe. Clinton, who is headed to an Asia-Pacific summit in Cambodia to be attended by Mr. Obama, said that the \"full faith and credit of the United States should never be in question.\" Clinton said responding to threats will always be central to American foreign policy, but it cannot be Washington's only foreign policy. Ahead of the polls, political parties urged their supporters to refrain from violence that marred the 2007 elections. Gregory Houel, who leads election observers from the U.S.-based Carter Center, told VOA the pledge appears to be working. \"We can say with a certain amount of confidence that the campaign period has been much more peaceful across the country, with fewer incidents of violence, fewer clashes between the ruling APC party and the opposition, mainly the SLPP,\" he said. Sierra Leone's electoral commission says it has taken steps to ensure the polls are credible, including training of staff. Commission spokesman Albert Massaquoi told VOA that results will be more announced quickly than in the past. \"These results at local levels, at constituent levels, and at district levels would be announced no sooner than (when) polls are closed. So, in a couple of days we would expect to have all the results finalized and announced, which would be the final results.\" President Koroma won the last presidential poll in 2007 in a runoff vote. His APC party currently holds the most seats of any party in parliament. These are the third national elections since the end of Sierra Leone's decade-long civil war in 2002. The U.S. has suspended sanctions on Burma and removed an import ban in recognition of Thein Sein's political and economic reforms after half a century of military rule, but Washington still wants him to end ethnic conflict and release all political prisoners. Some activists have warned that President Obama's trip risks rewarding a government that still has a poor human rights record. Human Rights Watch has called the trip \"premature.\" Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have hit a Hamas government building. The Cabinet headquarters was among targets hit early Saturday in Gaza.

Gatland, who was unveiled as the Lions' boss earlier this week , has hinted that outstanding club form could be enough to book a place on the plane Down Under with the likes of former England internationals Jonny Wilkinson and Mike Tindall on his radar. Wilkinson's chances of making what would be his third tour appear remote with the culmination of the Top 14 season, where he stars for Toulon, set to clash with the Lions' first tour game against the Barbarians in Hong Kong. Tindall, who has not played for England since last year's Rugby World Cup, is currently a player/coach with Premiership side Gloucester. \"Everyone is in contention,\" said Gatland. \"We are starting with a clean slate: no one is pencilled in. If you are playing well enough, whether it is Wilkinson or Tindall, you'll have a chance. In the past players have been selected out of club sides and done well. \"What will be reasonably important is that if they are not playing international rugby, they will have to come from a side that has done well at another level, such as the Heineken Cup. You need that comparison with Test rugby.\" However, the end of year internationals and the Six Nations are still set to be key proving grounds with Gatland keen to survey all of his options. The Kiwi will not be involved in Wales' Six Nations campaign, with Rob Howley taking temporary charge of the side, and is hoping to get access to the other squads during the battle for northern hemisphere supremacy. \"I would like to go to sessions, particularly early in the week,\" said Gatland. \"I am conscious that with England playing Wales in the last week of the Six Nations, they are probably not going to be keen on me coming in. I think we have been too insular in the northern hemisphere and not shared enough information. \"We had a number of Welsh staff on the last Lions tour and we gave away a lot of intellectual property. That is part of the role of the Lions in terms of sharing ideas. The big challenge is beating the southern hemisphere. It is great to win the Six Nations and the grand slam, but that is not good enough until we start beating the southern hemisphere. We are not far away, but we have to be more willing to share ideas. I am more than happy to be open.\" With the start of the autumn internationals, the countdown to the eagerly-awaited British & Irish Lions tour to Australia is well and truly on - check out Lions Watch for our pick of the in-form players"}

And stronger-than-expected earnings from Home Depot (NYSE: HD ) added to the optimism. But the market didn't sustain the higher prices, as Europe's woes put a halt to the early rally and stocks sagged from noon to the closing bell. At Tuesday close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3 points to 13,172, the S&P 500 was even at 1,404, and the Nasdaq fell 6 points to 3,017. The NYSE traded 565 million shares and the Nasdaq crossed 382 million. On the Big Board, breadth was only slightly negative, but on the Nasdaq, decliners were ahead of advancers by 1.7-to-1. Like yesterday's chart of the S&P 500 , the Dow industrials appear to be forming a triple-top. Seven trading days have topped at just over 13,200, while volume and breadth continue to shrink. On Tuesday, the stochastic issued a short-term sell signal, which could break the Dow to its 20-day moving average and a temporary bottom at 13,000. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) popped from its March low on Tuesday, and its stochastic flashed a positive signal -- a negative for stocks. It's a bit early to make decisions based on just one reversal of the VIX, but if a pattern of reversals from under 14 develops for a week or more, the indication would be bearish. Conclusion: Some technicians say that you should never sell into a boring market. If that's true, then what or who will kick the bull out of its slumber? Perhaps the Europeans are working on a plan to bring together a viable financial union. If so, the triple-top will break to the upside. But I think I'll continue to wait for a resolution to the crisis and not bet my 401(k) on a strong political/financial relationship between the north and south of the European continent. There have been too many cans kicked down the road from Berlin to Rome, and it appears that there is an unlimited supply of them."}

A period is a monthly bleed that happens approx. every 28 days (some girls cycles are longer, others shorter). Although it might not sound very nice, it is a completely natural and normal process.  Plus, it only lasts a few days and shows your body is healthy, fertile and working properly. In the past, periods were seen as something to feel bad about and came with a whole set of silly myths such as, you couldn't wash your hair while having one, or stand next to milk because it would curdle. Luckily, these days everyone knows that's rubbish and you can basically have one and carry on and live your life perfectly normally. Frequently asked questions... How much blood will I lose? Despite the fact that the blood flow may look heavy you will only lose about an egg cup full of blood. Bleeding can last anything from between 3-10 days. When can I expect my first period? This usually happens somewhere between the ages of 9 -16 years (or two years after your breasts start growing). However, don't worry if you start earlier or later than your friends. Our bodies have their own personal body clock for periods and puberty. If you're at all worried, see your GP for reassurance. How can I work out my period cycle? To work out approximately when your next period will begin, you need to count forward 28 days from the first day of your period. Are periods painful? Periods can sometimes be painful because of the hormone prostaglandin. Some girls produce too much of this hormone, and this makes the muscles of the womb go into cramp. You may get pains a day or two before your period starts. You can ease the pain by taking a painkiller or exercising or by placing a hot water bottle on your tummy. What sanitary protection should I use? Basically, whatever you feel is right for you and whatever you feel most comfortable with. The choices you have are: tampons: small, compacted absorbent cloth used internally, inserted into the vagina with an applicator or using a finger and has a string to assist removal sanitary towels: a piece of absorbent cloth that's worn outside the body. Some have adhesive strips to help stick to pants (keep away from pubes... you'll never make a mistake like that twice !!!!) or can have loops either end to attach to a belt. Tampons Any girl having a period can use tampons; it doesn't matter if she's a virgin. Tampons are rolls of cotton with a string attached to one end. They are inserted into the vagina using an applicator or with a finger, and once in place, cannot be felt.  The good news about tampons is you can be as active as you like with them, and even go swimming. You can also keep tampons in overnight and as long as you change them regularly (at least every eight hours) they are safe (see Toxic Shock Syndrome). You don't have to worry about them leaking, as long as you use the right size (mini, regular and super); just experiment and find what suits your period flow most. It's also impossible to lose one inside of you, but at the end of your period, always make sure you have removed your last tampon as it's sometimes easy to forget it's there. What is toxic shock syndrome(TSS)? TSS is a very rare condition caused by bacteria multiplying rapidly and being absorbed into the bloodstream. While TSS can affect men, women and children, about half of all cases have occurred in women using tampons, but don't worry, very, very few cases have occurred in the UK and as long as you change your tampons regularly (every eight hours) you don't have to worry. Sanitary pads/towels Pad/towels are now very thin, so no-one can tell if you're wearing one. They are also hygienic, and don't leak, as long as you change them regularly. These days they also come in a variety of forms - with wings (small adhesive flaps which help the pads stay in place in your pants), ultra thin (for day wear) and ultra absorbent (for night wear). Basically, you don't have to buy lots of different types, for different days, just experiment until you find a pad which suits you. Can I get pregnant while having a period? You can still get pregnant even if you have sex during your period. So make sure you always use a condom. A quick journey through your fertility cycle Days 1 -7 Physically: hormones are released from the brain and this kick-starts the production of the female fertility hormone - oestrogen which in turn starts your period cycle. Emotionally: you might feel relaxed and happy as your hormone level - which affect your moods and feelings - will be low. Days 7 -14 Physically: oestrogen will cause an egg to be released from your ovaries and at the same time, your womb lining will begin to thicken in preparation for the possible arrival of a fertilised egg. Emotionally: thanks to oestrogen you might feel at your most attractive right now and your confidence levels will be high. Days 14 -21 Physically: a ripe egg is released from your ovary i"}

There is simply no end to the sights on offer and no single best way to experience its archipelago, which hugs the coast from the north to the south of the country. We set our sights on the Kornati, a group of small clustered islands in the south, with peaks of up to 200m and plenty of Roman ruins to see. We never made it. Having been refused passage by an obnoxious ferry captain who was meant to take us from Zadar to Silba, we took a different one to Birbin, a quaint little port 20km to the north. As glitches go, this turned out to be a small one. The islands share a common topography and are all equally unique and mystical. Our 3-day trip, slipped in between essay deadlines and tutorials, had just the right balance of tough exercise and campfire relaxation that left your muscles aching and your mind refreshed. To the locals, late October in Croatia is far too cold for swimming and is generally known as the fishing season. Coming from Edinburgh we thought it was absolute paradise: a steady 22 degrees Celsius during the day and a mild 10 degrees at night with a water temperature of 21. We did get lucky, missing a thunderstorm that dissipated the day before our arrival, and there is certainly a risk involved with possibly being caught in a 'Bura' northern wind that often comes in hard and fast and lasts for a week. Other than that there are few dangers involved, you are rarely 50m from the coast of an island. For us, the water was completely placid for two days with not a cloud in sight. On the third day the weather picked up and the waves started coming in strong, spray decks are a necessity, as crests would often spill over the kayaks. The best thing about this trip is you can make it as demanding and challenging as you like, several routes are possible and you can pick the distance you want to travel on a last-minute basis, making some days intense and others more relaxing. Getting kayaks is not difficult but there is quite a high price to pay, 100 or so. Flights to Zadar are available from budget airlines in many airports, or you can fly to any city in Croatia as transport is generally cheap. Also, if exercise isn't your cup of tea, just spending a week touring the coast is well worth it, the country is beautiful."}

What price a view? Quite a lot in property terms for a stunning view can add considerably to the value of a house. \"A view can add 15-20% to the price  of a property, particularly properties with direct water views, as they rarely come to the market\" says Matthew Abernethy of Savills Richmond. \"Richmond Hill is renowned for its magnificent views across the river Thames and beyond and clients will often single out this area as the place they want to live.\" If you were lucky enough, for example, to live in a house with a view identical to the one in the quintessential painting 'View of the Thames from Richmond Hill' by J.M.W. Turner, then you would always have that fabulous historic outlook over the river every time you draw back your curtains. This view from this hill is the only one which is actually protected by an Act of Parliament -- the Richmond, Ham and Petersham Open Spaces Act passed in 1902. A little further down the Thames at Twickenham, Featherstone Leigh is marketing a three storey, double fronted Grade II listed house on The Embankment, overlooking the river and Eel Pie Island. It has been carefully refurbished and retains many original features. With five bedrooms, three reception rooms, a landscaped rear garden, off road parking and a 'secret' garden with water feature, the house is for sale for 2.95 million. Another property with river views is Sphinx on Pharaoh's Island in Shepperton. The three bedroom house was reputedly gifted to Lord Nelson in 1798 in recognition of his victory at the Battle of the Nile. It is only accessible by boat, so it has its own jetty on the mainland with a postbox and parking space and a private mooring. The property, which is set within half an acre grounds, also has a heated pool and extensive cellar. It is on the market through John D Wood with a guide price of 1.45 million. In Windsor, Hamptons International is marketing a development with stunning river views called Royal Windsor Quay. This is a distinctive development in the centre of Windsor, with an ultra contemporary design inside and out, of 16 properties -- two townhouses with roof terraces and 14 one, two and three bedroom apartments and penthouses. The floor to ceiling windows, which open onto large terraces and balconies, allow owners to fully appreciate the views -- day and night --  of the Thames. Three properties with river views remain for sale -- two two-bedroom townhouses for 815,000 and 950,000 and a two bedroom duplex apartment for 825,000. But it doesn't really matter whether the view is of sparkling water, glorious countryside or of a historic location. Not only do people like to have something really pretty to look at from their windows, whatever the time of  year, but a good view nearly always means that the land surrounding the house will be preserved, as no-one can build on a river and rarely are they allowed to build on greenfield. And if it's a really stunning panoramic view, so much the better. \"Views are quite difficult to come by in this area because most of the houses are set down in the trees, but we have one property, Fowlers, which has absolutely fabulous views from the front and the back of the house a very long way across typical English country-side\", says James Heron of Knight Frank's Ascot office. Heron says that a view of water will always add value and also attract people to the property, \"although some will drop out because they are worried about safety issues with their children and friends' children\" he adds. But in general, a good view will carry a premium of between 5 -- 10 per cent, as well as increasing the saleability of a property. Fowlers in Warfield is a charming five bedroom house, which has been recently refurbished. It has a reception hall with arched windows, three reception rooms, stables, gardens and grounds of 4.75 acres. Knight Frank is selling the house for 2.5 million. Knight Frank's Ascot office is selling Stanners Hill House, which has views over the Surrey Hills and Chobham Common, which it backs onto. It also has the prettiest of gardens with a large rose garden where each bed is edged with box hedges. The house, which has 7 bedrooms, 4 living rooms -- one of which is a vaulted reception room with galleried landing, a games room, pool, tennis court, stables, paddocks and woodland, has a guide price of 4.25 million. Octagon's latest release is 5/6 bedroom Keeper's Wood, a detached house with 5,000 sq ft of living space, set in 0.7 acre, on the Wentworth Estate in Virginia Water, Surrey. There isn't really a bad view from any vantage point on the Wentworth Estate, which is a warren of quiet grass verged lanes lined with beautiful family homes. The rear of the house has a deep paved terrace, a perfect location to take in the fabulous fully landscape"}

Cleveland thought the play was a catch, fumble and Browns recovery. Almost immediately, CBS went to commercial and when Gumbel and Dierdorf returned, we heard Ed Hochuli explain that the previous play was not a reviewable play, that a timeout to Cleveland was charged and \"...and the ruling on the field stands -- although as I said it's not a reviewable play, I didn't review it.\" As Football Zebras puts it, \"[b]ecause the call on the field was a play-killing call, replay cannot overturn that call and add a subsequent action.\" In other words, since the replay could not reverse the call on the field to make it a completed pass and also then add a fumble recovery by the Browns, the play was not-reviewable. After the ruling was made, Dierdorf mentions that Hochuli went to the replay hood saying the play was under review, so presumably the booth buzzed down to Hochuli. Maybe Ed set the booth straight and informed the officials this was not reviewable. Or maybe Hochuli and the booth merely discussed that the play was not reviewable -- it's unclear. What is clear is Hochuli's amusement over the suspension of disbelief required for the whole thing."}

From 1217 Francis sent communities of friars throughout Christendom and launched missions to several countries, including India and China. The movement soon became established in most cities and several large towns, and, enjoying close relations with the popes, its followers were ideal instruments for the propagation of the reforms of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. They quickly became part of the landscape of medieval life and made their influence felt throughout society. This book explores the first 250 years of the order's history and charts its rapid growth, development, pastoral ministry, educational organisation, missionary endeavour, internal tensions and divisions. Intended for both the general and more specialist reader, it offers a complete survey of the Franciscan Order.

We all know how the rhyme goes. It is about Lizzie Borden, the acquitted suspect but legendary perpetrator of the grisly double murder of her father Andrew Borden and her stepmother Abby, on August 4, 1892. The home has since been a city landmark due to the infamous ax murders. It was erected in 1845 and was originally built for two families, but was later made into a single family by Mr. Borden. Andrew J. Borden bought the house at 92 Second Street to be close to his bank and various downtown businesses. Since the murders on in 1892, the house spent most of its history as a private residence. Now the public is allowed not only to view the murder scene but to spend a night in the actual house where the murders took place. The home is now called the \" Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast \" Before we continue telling you about the reported hauntings and ghostly sightings, we feel that it would be good to tell you a bit more about Lizzy Borden and give you a brief history of what supposedly happened on the scorching morning of August 4th, 1892. The History __________________________________ Opinion about Lizzie was divided, even by those who knew her. Certainly the mind of Lizzie Borden seemed to hold two entirely different personalities. While one kept awake with one eye open, the other, deep inside her, slept. There is Lizzie, the good daughter, who made sure that her father was all comfortable and tucked in for a nap on the lounge of which he never rose from again. Then there is Lizzie, the bad daughter. The one who would incessively say bitter things about him behind his back and not talk to him for days when she was angry with him. Robert Sullivan, in his objective research of the case, Good-bye Lizzie Borden, actually interviewed Mrs. Abby Whitehead Potter (Abby Borden's niece and namesake), who remembered her aunt and recalled this chilling tale: \"Lizzie Borden had company and my aunt had a tabby cat and the cat was trained so that it would touch the latch -- you know, it was [sic] latches in those days -- she'd touch the latch and the door would open. So the cat went in where Lizzie was entertaining and she took it out and shut the door again, and came back so this is what she told Aunt Abby and Abby told my mother; Lizzie Borden finally excused herself and went downstairs -- took the cat downstairs -- and put the carcass on the chopping block and chopped its head off. My aunt for days wondered where that cat was -- all she talked about. Finally, Lizzie said, 'You go downstairs and you'll find your cat.' My aunt did\" (Sullivan, 23). Whether the story is accurate or not, by 9 o'clock that hot August morning Abby had died much the same way as the cat. Her head was nearly torn off her shoulders by a blunt instrument as she lay face down on the floor of the upstairs bedroom. Forensic experts at the time judge that she had seen her attacker when struck. It was found that her head was crushed by 19 axe or hatchet wounds in the back of the scalp. Because of the lack of blood, it has been surmised that Abby died from the first blow, and with death her heart stopped pumping blood. Once the killer finished with the victim, the 200-pound corpse lay sprawled out on the knees face down waiting to be discovered two hours later. Meanwhile, Old Andrew Borden went calmly on his rounds of business to the Union Savings Bank, to the National Union Bank, to the First National Bank of Fall River and then to see one of his tenants, the hatter Jonathan Clegg. At 10:40 a.m. his next-door neighbour Mrs. Kelly saw him at his front door as she hurried on to a dentist's appointment, unkown to the fact that he would not leave the house alive. Less than an hour later his daughter Lizzie called up to the maid, resting in her attic room, \"Come down quick! Father's dead! Somebody came in and killed him!\" It was there, in the small little sitting room, where the dead body of Mr. Borden lay, with his head and face so hacked as to be unrecognizable even to his friend and physician, Dr. Bowen, who attended the scene. Again, the mysterious murderer struck violently to the head. According to Robert Sullivan: \"Borden's head was bent slightly to the right, but his face was almost unrecognizable as human; one eye had been cut in half and protruded in a ghastly manner, his nose had been severed, and there were eleven distinct cuts within a relatively small area extending from the eye and nose to the ears. Fresh blood was still seeping from the wounds, which were so severe that the first of the eleven blows must have killed him.\" Although she was tried and acquitted of these gruesome crimes, Lizzie Borden and her hatchet have caused more confusion, speculation and debate than any other murder case in American history.

It's a wonderful example of investigative and data driven journalism made possible (sadly) by the recent spat of sexual-abuse and bankruptcy cases. As a result some of the normally secret financial records of the Church have been made public enabling the Economist to reconstruct the secret and opaque general finances of the Catholic church in America. It is a fascinating, and at times disturbing read. The articles also suggests -- I believe -- a broader lessons for non-profits, governments and companies. Disclosure and transparency are essential to the effective running of an organization. As you read the piece it is clear that more disclosure would probably have compelled the Church to manage its finances in a more fiscally sound manner. It probably would have also made acts that are, at best negligent, at worst corrupt, difficult to impossible. This is, indeed, why many charities, organizations and public companies must conduct audits and publish the results. But conforming to legal requirements will not shield you from an angry public. My sense is that many member contribution based organizations -- from public companies to clubs to governments, are going to feel enormous pressure from their \"contributors\" to disclose more about how funds are collected, managed, disbursed and used. In a post financial collapse and post Enron era it's unclear to me that people trust auditors the way they once did. In addition, as technology makes it easier to track money in real time, contributors are going to want more than just an annual audit. Even if they look at it rarely, they are going to want to know there is a dashboard or system they can look at and understand that shows them where the money goes. I'm open to being wrong about this -- and I'm not suggesting this is a panacea that solves all problems, but I nonetheless suspect that many organizations are going to feel pressure to become more transparent. There will be good ways in which that takes place... and bad ways. The Catholic Church story in the Economist is probably an example of the worst possible way: transparency forced upon an organization through the release of documents in a court case. For anyone running an non-profit, community group, public agency or government department -- this makes the article doubly worth reading. It is a case study in the worst possible scenario for your organization. The kind of disaster you never want to have to deal with. The problem is, and I'm going to go out on a limb here, is that, at some point in the next 10-20 years, there is a non-trivial risk any organization (including your's, reader) will face a publicity or legitimacy crisis because of a real or imagined problem. Trust me when I tell you: that moment will not be the moment when it is easiest or desirable from a cost, political and cultural perspective, to make your organization more transaparent. So better for you to think about how you'd like to shift policies, culture and norms to make it more transparent and accountable today, when things are okay, than in the crisis. Consider again the Catholic Church. There are some fascinating and disturbing facts shared in the story that provide some interesting context. On the fascinating side, I had no idea of the scope and size of the Catholic Church. Consider that, according to the article: \"Almost 100m Americans, a third of the nation, have been baptised into the faith and 74m identify themselves as Catholic.\" and \"there are now over 6,800 Catholic schools (5% of the national total); 630 hospitals (11%) plus a similar number of smaller health facilities; and 244 colleges and universities.\" We are talking about a major non-profit that is providing significant services into numerous communities. It also means that the Catholic church does a lot of things that many other non-profits do. Whatever you are doing, they are probably doing it too. Now consider some of the terrible financial practices the Church tried/tries to get away with because it thinks no one will be able to see them: Lying about assets: \"In a particularly striking example, the diocese of San Diego listed the value of a whole city block in downtown San Diego at $40,000, the price at which it had been acquired in the 1940s, rather than trying to estimate the current market value, as required. Worse, it altered the forms in which assets had to be listed. The judge in the case, Louise Adler, was so vexed by this and other shenanigans on the part of the diocese that she ordered a special investigation into church finances which was led by Todd Neilson, a former FBI agent and renowned forensic accountant. The diocese ended up settling its sexual-abuse cases for almost $200m.\" Playing fast "}

If we went off the grounds we had to be chaperoned. Books were chosen for us and were normally about Scientology. We had to wear uniform all the time, even at weekends. It was a navy blue polo, navy blue trousers and dark trainers. \"We had school from 9am to 3pm. The subjects were the same as normal school except there was no RE or sex education. Our teachers didn't seem properly trained and we didn't take GCSEs. We had to take different courses, like ones in maths, and after we had finished we had to go in front of the class and take the E-meter test. \"This means holding a sort of can in each hand while the teacher takes an electronic reading. If we didn't pass, we had to do the whole course again. They call it auditing and you are constantly audited throughout your time with Scientology to make sure you are following their ways. \"There was never any playtime during breaks. Mostly you spent your time in silence -- there was never any laughing or playing, like at a normal school.\" After school, the children had to do volunteer work in the grounds. Shelley said: \"It was called chores but I would say it bordered on child labour. Father and daughter ... Shelley at nine with dad Peter Peter Jordan \"At eight I was cleaning huge, long drains and scrubbing toilet floors. It was a complete life of drudgery, like something out of Dickens's day. There were never any treats. We weren't allowed sweets, ice cream or fizzy drinks.\" After dinner there would be at least two hours of Scientology study, then bed. Shelley said: \"For years I cried myself to sleep. I felt like I'd been taken from a perfect world and dumped in this terrible place. \"At the age of eight I had to write a history of my life and answer about 300 questions which included 'How many boyfriends have you had?' and 'How many sexual partners have you had?' \"It was all crazy stuff. If they felt you had misbehaved they would make you write Overts and Withholds, or what they call OWs. \"You had to write down every bad thing you had done -- it was like a confessional. You even had to admit to pleasuring yourself if you had. \"If you'd secretly eaten chocolate you had to write that down, or if you'd sworn. At the end you presented it to the teacher and then took the E-meter to see if you were really sorry for what you had done. \"It was all about control, control, control. It felt like brainwashing, like they were trying to mould you into what they wanted you to be. \"On the rare times I saw my dad I would beg him to let me leave but he refused. He was totally committed to them.\" Scientologist rockers ... Shelley's father's band Jive Aces ITV Shelley's dad is the drummer in the band the Jive Aces -- whose members are all Scientologists. In January this year they appeared on Britain's Got Talent but Shelley said her dad didn't reveal he was a Scientologist when he was on the ITV1 show. She added: \"He would often be away with the band, appearing at Scientology events, but ironically I wasn't allowed access to any pop music.\" She added: \"I did try running away several times but I was always found and brought back. After Cadet Org you go into Sea Org when you are a teenager. Sea Org are seen as the top elite of Scientology. I was sent to Florida to join the Sea Org there and it was far more intense than in the UK. \"It was like being in the army. You had to walk in lines, do drills. If you messed up you had to drop down and do 20 press-ups. \"The American Scientologists seemed even more obsessive than the UK ones. I was relieved when they decided I didn't meet their standards and was sent home.\" Shelley said teenagers are not encouraged to have boyfriends or girlfriends and friendships with non-Scientologists are banned. She continued: \"Sex before marriage is forbidden. A lot of Scientologist teenagers I knew ended up getting married at 17. \"But they are banned from having children if they are in Sea Org because you are supposed to be elite Scientologists and they believe that children are a distraction.\" Finally, when she was 17, Shelley hatched a plan she believed would get her thrown out. She said: \"They would not let me go. I thought I was trapped for ever but I knew there was one thing they would not tolerate -- and that was sex before marriage. \"So I managed to persuade them to let me visit some of the other Scientology mansions near London. \"During the trip I met a non-Scientologist and had sex with him. Then when I got back to my HQ I confessed all. \"They were absolutely furious. They put me through all sorts of weird tests, then eventually they agreed I could leave. \"But I had to sign an agreement saying I would never talk about my time with them. They also presented me with a 'freeloader' bill, charging me for every Scientology course I ever had. \"It was about 7,000 but I've never paid it.

One was in the \"Grateful Dead Documentary\" produced by Vance Frost and Michael Wanger: \"I originally heard the tune off a Carl Perkins record and he was, like, a good country guy, country guitar player, and he played finger style, and he did a kind of a rockabilly version of Sittin' on Top of the World .\" The other was in an interview with Ralph Gleason, reproduced in \"The Grateful Dead Reader\": \" Sittin' on Top of the World is another traditional song that was copyrighted some time not too long ago by some country and western guy but it's still essentially a folk song. There are just two or three verses and they're standard blues verses that turn up everywhere.\" The song was originally written by The Mississippi Sheiks, and recorded by them in 1930. The tune and the chorus are pretty much as the Dead played it (though the Dead's version is much faster), but the lyrics for the verses are very different, with only some fragments of verses in common: Worked all the summer, and all the fall Just trying to find my little all in all But now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sitting on top of the world Was in the spring, one summer day Just when she left me, she's gone to stay But now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sitting on top of the world Don't you come here runnin', holdin' up your hand Can't get me a woman, quick as you get a man But now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sitting on top of the world It have been days, I didn't know your name Why should I worry and pray in vain But now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sitting on top of the world Went to the station, down in the yard Gonna get me a freight train, work done got hard But now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sitting on top of the world The lonesome days, they have gone by Why should you beg me and say goodbye But now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sitting on top of the world The Carl Perkins' version is played at a similar fast tempo to the Dead's, and shares most of the same verses - including those not in the Mississippi Sheik's original version. But, interestingly, Carl Perkins doesn't sing the \"Saw her in Dallas ...\" verse that Garcia sings. The Carl Perkins lyrics are: You come here running, holding out your hand I can get me a woman, you can have your man Lord I'm gone, I don't worry Baby I'm sitting on top of the world Mississippi river so deep and wide My baby's standing on the other side Lord I'm gone, I don't worry 'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world You come here running, holding out your hand I can get me a woman, you can have your man Lord I'm gone, I don't worry Baby I'm sitting on top of the world Work all summer, work all the fall Blond-headed chicken, she caused it all Lord I'm gone, I don't worry 'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world You come here running, holding out your hand Get me a woman, you can have your man Lord I'm gone, I don't worry Lord I'm sitting on top of the world Lord I'm sitting on top of the world Sittin' On Top Of The World has been covered by a wide range of performers. Bob Wills recorded a much slower version in the 1930s, including some verses borrowed from other songs (eg \"Stealing\"): All the summer, all the fall Tryin' to find my little all and all And now she's gone, I don't worry I'm sittin' on top of the world Yes the world There has been days, didn't know your name Why should I worry, sit around and blame And now you're gone, I don't worry ( not much ) I'm sittin' on top of the world Of the world You've seen me stealin', don't tell on me Just stealin' back to, my same old used to be But now she's gone, and I don't worry 'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world Late in the evening, honey babe, way after school Remember darling, we broke the rule And now you're gone, and I don't worry I'm sittin' on top of the world We never had one girl at a time We always had seven eight or nine But now they're gone, but we don't worry ( at least not much ) 'Cause we're sittin' on top of the world I'm going to the station, way down in the yard Gonna catch me a freight train, work's done got hard And though she's gone, I don't worry 'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world Among others versions, Jerry Garcia would almost certainly have heard the Bill Monroe version, which included the \"Dallas/El Paso\" verse that the Dead sang: It was in the spring one sunny day My good gal left me Lord she went away But now she's gone but I don't worry Lord I'm sitting on top of the world She called me in Dallas, in El Paso Said come on, daddy, I need you so But now she's gone but I don't worry Lord I'm sitting on top of the world Ashes to ashes, dust to dust Show me a woman a man can trust But now she's gone but I don't worry Lord I'm sitting on top of the world The Mississippi River, long, deep and wide The woman I'm loving is on the other side But now she's gone but I don't worry Lord I'm sitting on top of the world [ the next two verses we"}

It wasn't long before someone stopped by and wanted to buy it. Soon, \"I had to get a shop and hire an employee, and then two and three and a bookkeeper,\" said Bent, who now employs 14 people at Legacy Classic Trucks, which specializes in Power Wagon restorations and conversions. Bent grew up in the Chicago area, where his father collected classic cars. Winslow raced and restored cars, earned a degree in business and communications from Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., and at some point he became a fan of Dodge's classic work and military trucks. He searches throughout Wyoming, Montana and Idaho for donor bodies, and he has a knack for finding trucks that were used by potato farmers, telephone companies, even fire departments, and pulling them out of fields and back to his garage. There, the bodies are restored and mounted over new running gear and modern components. Clients can select a regular or extended-cab configuration or even a four-door architecture, pick a gasoline or diesel engine, manual or automatic transmission, and various other components. \"A lot of our clients aren't car people,\" Bent said as he stood next to the four-door Power Wagon he has on display at the SEMA Show this week in Las Vegas. \"Primarily, they are second-home owners who want something to complement their ranch.\" But, he adds, even though clients want the look of the old Power Wagon, they also want a vehicle than can cruise comfortably and quietly down the interstate. He said the example he brought to SEMA gets 23 mpg from its 3.9-liter Cummins turbo-diesel powertrain and can cruise along at  75 mph, but it also has a 100:1 reduction gear, a 16,000-pound winch mounted up front and a 12,000-pound winch at the rear, should an owner ever want to venture far away from pavement. Features incorporated into the Legacy restorations include four-wheel-disc brakes, air conditioning, power steering and leather interiors. Bent already has sold completed Power Wagons to people who live in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand, and he just started working on his 25th Power Wagon restoration. He's had such unexpected success with Power Wagons that he's also starting to take on clients who want other classic trucks, including a Willys and an old Chevy Suburban. Power Wagon prices start at $120,000. The truck on display at SEMA is a $185,000 unit. Awesome truck and worth every dime. Thanks for the article. My next truck is going to be a power wagon.

Read out loud for maximum benefit. The story is written in the first person. Although it is factual and autobiographical it only covers a portion of the author's life, beginning in 1984 with a two year stay in Saudi Arabia as an advisor to Saudi Telecom. At the end of a vacation in Kashmir, John's Indian Airlines flight is hijacked to Lahore in Northern Pakistan. After leaving Saudi Arabia the author's world tour is cut short when he lands in a hospital in Norway with a spinal meningitis-induced coma. Waking from the coma just long enough to prevent a potentially lethal injection of penicillin (to which he is allergic) leaves John with questions about the nature of existence. This changes his trip into a journey of discovery that spans two and a half years and every habitable continent save South America. A remarkable, almost unbelievable, chain of coincidences leads the way and shows the author when he's on the right track. Travels initially range through South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Meetings with remarkable individuals ensue, including Mark, the ex-advertising executive from America, who gave it all away to plant trees in the Australian hinterlands. In Papua New Guinea the author is profoundly touched by the simple, harmonious way of living of the Trobriand Islanders. During a freighter trip up the Fly River, also in PNG, John begins to clarify his vision of creating a simple, self sufficient lifestyle. At the end of that river journey John sees the devastating environmental impact of one of the world's largest gold mines, Ok Tedi. He then goes off the track to come face to face with some of the last people on the planet untouched by Western civilization. After a brief poignant interlude in the Philippines and a return to Canada to attend a wedding, the story resumes in China. Here John gets an appendicitis scare and encounters the insanely apathetic Chinese medical system. Strength of will propels him forward and upwards over the Khunjerab pass into fabled Hunza in Northern Pakistan. Deteriorating health and further coincidental meetings in Nepal and India propel John to seek the assistance of the great Tibetan healer, Dr. Yeshi Dhonden, in Dharmsala in northern India. It is also in Dharmsala, home of the Dalai Lama and a thriving Tibetan community, that the author experiences a profound spiritual awakening that leaves his life transformed and his purpose clear. At this time he meets Lucia, his future wife, and begins to receive a series of coincidental messages pointing him in the direction of Santa Fe, New Mexico. An eventful return to the Hunza takes on a surreal quality through an encounter with a ghost and beams of light projecting from the mountains. All told, eleven months are spent in the Himalayas before that undeniable chain of coincidences leads John through Africa to Europe for a reunion with Lucia before heading to New Mexico to meet his destiny at a unique property outside Santa Fe. Here, this story ends and the sequel begins. That book is due to be released later in 2009. In Search of Simplicity is the extraordinary story of an ordinary man, told with a blend of humor, penetrating insight and adventure. The book is no mere travel saga. It is an adventure into the very heart of life that leaves every reader transformed. There is a message of ecological oneness and of the unity that exists at the core of all religions and beliefs. There is a message of hope and personal healing and finding one's personal mission in life. And the story is all the more real because it is true and is tempered with sometimes humorous incidents and flashbacks to earlier times in the author's life. Chapter 1  Saudi Arabia and Chapter 2 The Hijacking in Kashmir A man traveled the world in search of Divine Knowledge, in search of the Truth. He visited many countries and consulted with many wise beings and teachers. And although he gained great insight and wisdom, he hadn't yet found that which he sought, that which would free him from suffering and from the wheel of birth, death and rebirth. Finally he arrived in a lush land of ancient mystery. He was tired. I've done enough searching, he thought. It is time for a rest. This looks as good a place as any. So he sat in the shade of a huge wizened tree, a tree seemingly almost as old as the land itself. He rested his aching back against the trunk of that gigantic denizen of the forest and looked out upon a sun dappled glade of emerald grass and wildflowers. This is a good place to stop , he thought, wiping his brow with the sleeve of his travel-faded tunic. But wouldn't it be nice to have some fresh water? Wow , thought the traveler. My thirst will be quenched, but not my hunger. Wouldn't it be nice to have something to eat ? Amazingly, a table appeared beside the stream, laden with the freshest and most exquisite food"}

Christchurch has had to put up with a swathe of demolition over the last couple of years, and they are getting so good at destroying everything down there, that they have forgotten that it is not compulsory. Cranmer Courts is their city's latest disgrace -- the Harcourts building is ours. Somewhat bizarrely, the Harcourts building, owned by elderly eccentric Mark Dunajtschik, is not at risk of collapsing in a seismic situation. It has a strong steel skeleton frame, and does not need to be demolished. It is a Chicago style building, so we are told, yet has none of the verve and excitement of a Louis Sullivan original, nor the decoration of the facade in the manner that truly befits that name. But the building is there, has been there for quite a while, and doesn't actually need to be demolished. Instead, there is the chance for bits to fall off in a quake, and as the bits are large, then they could kill. Consequently, Dunajtschik wants to demolish the whole building, and start again -- ooh, going up to 25 floors as well. The reason being touted for this work is the cost of earthquake strengthening, but the real reason is that the developer wants to build a bigger building. The sort of thing that would happen in the 80s was that the developer would just start demolishing, and that was that. No asking permission. But here we are in the 10s, and now the public has a chance to partake in the discussion. The developer, Mark Dunajtschik, is of course furious that the public has been allowed a chance for input into the discussion. The public, we hope, are overjoyed at the chance to contribute. The Fish, I think, is here to help facilitate that discussion. I'm not sure if the proposal is just to demolish, or if it includes a proposed replacement yet. The DomPost editorial today advocates that the use of a polystyrene replacement facade be permitted, and that the Historic Places Trust should just pull its head in and stop complaining. HPT presumably thinks that they would rather poke out their eyeballs with a blunt stick than permit a poly palace replica. I'm more worried about Dunajtschik's track record -- the excrescence that is the IRD tub of lard HQ -- the appallingly bad Asteron House is not a good precedent for thoughtful and sensitive insertion into the urban fabric. Dunajtschik, of course, is more worried about \"the Loony left\" and the \"fruitcakes\" having a say. It's our city too, Mark! Your thoughts, please? MarkBrandenburg 3 - 10 - 12 A successful city is one that is buzzing with the activity of people and businesses. Empty heritage buildings do nothing to add to that. I agree the building certainly adds to the street scape of the city. However people seem to over fixate on heritage buildings and trying to keep them forever. This building would have replaced an older building which if it was still standing would also be seen as a heritage building. That building may well have also replaced and earlier building which again if still standing today would be seen as heritage. As a resident of the inner city the issue I have is not that the owner my want to demolish it. It is what replaces it. If they put a quality new building that adds to the life and vibrancy of the city then I am all for it. A city filled with empty uneconomic buildings does nothing for the vitality and success of the city. Maximus 3 - 10 - 12 Trying to find out what is proposed to replace it. Or is the present proposal just to demolish? Surely, the argument must be that any potential replacement should be better than what the existing building is. Info on the existing building on the HPT website is.... sparse. Link added into post above. Info on the proposed building, is available at the Council and the library. Haven't got there yet! Clarke 3 - 10 - 12 I love the fact that everyone opposed to a 25 storey nondescript office block rammed through a polystyrene pastiche of a heritage facade is a \"looney leftie\". I now feel much more comfortable characterising Dunajtschik as an architecturally illiterate money-grubbing right-wing sociopath. Gary 4 - 10 - 12 I've been trying to find this building on the official HPT Register via the HPT website. It appears to have absolutely no entry, and therefore, as such, presumably has no heritage value. So the way would appear to be clear to tear it down. If the officials in charge of heritage can't be bothered to care about it, why the heck should any of the rest of us care? Maximus 4 - 10 - 12 No, it is there, just buried. Nothing comes up if you search for it by address. But if you just happen to know the register number, 1435, then that finds it. Interestingly, however, there is hardly any info there. The HPT Register somewhat lamely notes: OPINION: In response to Kent Duston (Letters, Oct 4), to demolish the Harcourts Building and red"}

Meanwhile, Nicaragua's representative at the court Carlos Arguello said the verdict \"couldn't have been better\" because it ended a long-running maritime boundary dispute, and extended Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty in the Caribbean. \"What was the most important for our country was that the ICJ recognizes Nicaraguan sovereignty over maritime spaces, which Colombia assumed as exclusively theirs,\" said Arguello. In 1928, both countries signed the Esguerra-Barcenas Treaty establishing that the Mosquito Coast and nearby islands belong to Nicaragua, while the San Andres islands and Providencia belong to Colombia. But in 1980, the Nicaraguan government declared the agreement null and void, claiming sovereignty over San Andres and Providencia. In 2001, Nicaragua formally presented its claim to the court, which began trying the case in 2007. The presentation of proofs ended in 2011."}

You agree to pay for them in instalments, and you both agree how long it will take. When you make the last payment you can collect the goods. Terms and conditions of layby What deposit can I ask for? The amount of the deposit is decided by you and the customer. It is not specified in the Layby Sales Act. How long should I give the customer to finish making payments? You and the customer decide the term of the layby including the frequency of instalments. It is not specified in the Layby Sales Act. You should make sure that customers know how long they have to complete the layby and how often they are required to make payments. Holding the goods You must hold the goods chosen by the customer until the payments are completed and you give the goods to the customer, or until the contract is cancelled. If you sell the goods to someone else, you must provide the customer with replacement goods. If this isn't possible, you must provide the customer with a refund of all the money that has been paid. The customer can also claim any increase in price if they have to go to another shop to obtain the same goods. Customer's right to request a written statement The customer is entitled to request and receive a written statement every 30 days. The law says that a customer should request the statement in writing and pay 25 cents for it and that you must provide the statement within seven days. Normally, retailers will provide a statement for a customer who calls in to the shop. The statement must show: the price of the goods what the customer has paid so far the current balance owing the current retail value of the goods and any consequent loss in value that has occurred since the goods were put on layby the selling costs the amount of the refund if the layby is cancelled.You will need to keep a record of payments made by the customer to be able to supply a statement when requested. Recording payments Each time a customer makes a payment you should give a receipt, or record it on a payment record slip given to the customer. This will assist your customers to keep track of their layby and to remember when payments are due. Layby sale cancellation The customer can cancel a layby at any time, and does not have to give a reason. The customer can cancel verbally or in writing. They may be entitled to a refund as specified in the Layby Sales Act. Seller's right to cancel You can cancel the layby whenever the customer does not stick to the terms of the agreement. The right of the seller to cancel the layby is not in the Layby Sales Act, you are entitled to cancel the layby because the customer has breached their layby contract with you. For instance, if they do not make payments as often as requested or do not complete payments within the specified time. BUT you must tell the customer that you are cancelling the layby. If you do not tell them, the layby contract is still in effect. The refund should be calculated using a specific formula. It is up to the customer to come and claim the refund. Right to retain deposit You cannot simply decide that you will keep the deposit in every case. You should calculate what refund the customer is entitled to according to the Layby Sales Act. Calculating refunds When customers cancel a layby they are usually entitled to a refund. You may choose to refund all of their deposit plus the payments they have made. Alternatively, you may wish to calculate the exact refund they are entitled to by using the following formula. AMOUNT PAID (Deposit + Payments) minus DEDUCTIONS (Selling costs + Loss in value) equals REFUND/DEBT Selling costs Selling costs are the actual costs associated with the layby sale, such as the cost of storing the goods and the staff time taken in preparing receipts. These costs may be calculated in several different ways, but the simplest method is to assign an amount to each of these items. For example, you might estimate that the sale took 5 minutes and that the customer making two payments took another 10 minutes. You can then calculate the cost of 15 minutes of the shop assistant's time and add to this any storage costs. In a court case in 1985, the judge ruled that if a retailer's estimate of selling costs is challenged, he or she must be able to show that the estimate is a reasonable one that takes into account only the actual selling costs associated with that particular sale. Loss in value Loss in value is the loss in the retail value of the goods. For example, goods may lose value because they are no longer in season or because a new model has been produced. Example of loss in value A customer puts a $90 winter jersey on layby in April and then cancels the layby in August. The shop has started stocking it's spring range of clothes and all winter jerseys are on sale. Winter clothing in other shops is now on special so the jersey has lost value. If the sale price is now $60, then the loss in value is $30. Ass"}

Not the kind of thing you'd expect to see on Fridge Scrapings, right?  It's not like I need much encouragement to get my fill of greens. MY vegetable intake aside, when approached to do a review of this book, I was pretty interested in getting my hands on a copy.  Convincing Viper to chomp through a huge bowl of steamed greens is not really the easiest thing to do, and I am always up for new ideas to make veggies exciting for the un-enthusiastic. Anyway, Lora Krulak's notion of \"moving vegetables to the centre of the plate,\" is one I really try and push at home -- meat is fine (if you are that way inclined) but try to make the veggie component of your meal the main attraction. I really loved this book -- Lorna has a really engaging \"voice\" throughout -- the book is filled with interesting stories, fascinating facts and the whole tone of the book is kind of like a friendly chat, if that makes sense?  I'm all about the whole experience when it comes to reading a recipe book -- I don't just want the recipe, I want to know where the inspiration for the dish came from, I want to know a little about the different ingredients that go into it -- the whole shebang.  Lorna caters for my tastes perfectly -- the information she provides is succinct and extensive without being overwhelming \"wordy\" or \"health-food-preachy.\" The book goes through \" The Basics ,\" (equipment and preparation work)  \" Dips & Spreads,\" \"Sauces & Dressings,\" \"Soups & Salads,\" \"Small Plates,\" and \"Smoothies/Tonics,\" -- it covers the majority of veggie-based bases for sure.  A girl who loves to travel, the flavour profiles in Lorna's recipes cover a multitude of countries and cultures, so boredom is not even an option. I think the main attraction of this book, as Lorna gives you not only recipes, but the creative inspiration and \"building blocks\" to help you design countless dishes -- it's the like gift that keeps on giving. I suppose I am greedy to want there to be more of a sweet-treat section, considering this is a veggie-based book, but Lorna DOES cover a variety of smoothies to get in a little sweetie- fix.  I made her Chocolate Peanut Butter Milk (above) for myself and Misty, and it was delicious, although I did need to add some sweetness to the final product.  There is a natural sweetener guide in the front of the book, and Lorna considers her top 5 -- Yacon Syrup, Maple Syrup, Raw Honey, Molasses and Coconut sugar. My only criticism of this book would be the lack of visual appeal -- the layout and photographs lack pizazz, and you'd think with such stellar content, you would want the book to LOOK as fantastic as possible?  Anyway, that aside, this is a fabulous book if you are lacking a bit of creativity in the vegetable department, OR you want to convince friends/family of their amazing appeal. You can go HERE to download a free sample of the book if it's the sort of thing that tickles your fancy. I also made the Aloo Gobi Dip , which is an Indian spiced cauliflower spread.... although I did run out of olive oil, so it ended up on the thick side (just how I like it) -- absolutely delicious.  I am looking forward to creating more of the recipes -- Viper has requested the Cauliflower Steaks with Harissa Sauce , and I have my eye on the Middle Eastern Squash Puree, which sounds like it would be right up Misty's alley (or it would make for some lovely coloured finger paint). ** I received a copy of Veggies for Carnivores at not cost, however the thoughts and opinions expressed in this post are my own -- I was not paid to write this.... I just like to share. Oh fabulous! It must be a huge (and expensive) process to put together such a book -- you did such an amazing job.... and I KNOW you would have learnt so many lessons and tricks for round #2 (can't wait!) The content is the most important part of any book -- and you nailed it!

Ben Fraser Three people have been injured and a family have lost everything in an early morning Fordlands house fire. But the family say they owe their lives to their smoke alarm. The Rotorua Fire Service was called to the Wrigley Rd house at 5am yesterday to put out a fire which had started in the kitchen and spread to the rest of the house. A woman who lived in the house, who didn't want to be named, said all the people who were in the house managed to get out safely, although there were some cuts and bruises from climbing out a window. She said the smoke alarm they had installed outside the kitchen door saved their lives. \"We were asleep when it happened, the kitchen was all closed off but it was enough for some smoke to get out and set the alarm off. There were a few injuries from trying to get out of the house, they went in the ambulance.'' Two of the three people injured were males aged 18 and 19. The gender and age of the third person was unclear. Their neighbours were also a huge help to the family. When the family woke up to the alarm, the woman realised their phone was in the kitchen, so they were unable to call the emergency services. \"There's a lot of people to thank. Our next-door neighbour rang the fire brigade and another lady rang the ambulance. Someone also brought us food, they've all been really nice. \"The staff at the hospital were especially good, I was grateful for their patience treating two of the boys, it was a job well done. All the support we've had has just been fantastic, I feel quite blessed.'' Another family member had offered to house the family until their situation was sorted and there had also been people providing clothing.  All of their furniture, bedding and appliances have been destroyed. After returning from the hospital, the woman said seeing the mess their home was in had really brought home the message about having a smoke alarm. She said she wasn't sure how the fire had started, but could only guess something had been left on the stove. Their dog had also been taken away to be treated for smoke inhalation. Fire communications shift manager Steve Smith said by the time they got the call at 5am the fire was ``well involved''. \"When they got there, some guy had jumped out the window and hurt his leg. The fire service were at the house until just before 7am [yesterday] morning but they left one truck there to make sure it didn't flare up again.'' He said fire safety officers were at the home until 9.45am. Rotorua Fire Service assistant fire commander Nigel Richards said the fire highlighted the importance of smoke alarms. He said most people wouldn't wake up to the smell of smoke, so it was very likely the smoke alarm saved the family's lives. Mr Richards said they were told the fire started in the kitchen and were to decide today whether to investigate further. A St John communications officer said three patients were treated for minor injuries and were taken to Rotorua Hospital."}

While that's one way of going about it, it probably makes more sense to figure out what else is happening on the table. Turkey is turkey is turkey, and matches well with anything from the hearty white (California Chardonnay or Viognier, Rhone blends) to the lightweight-but-firm red (Pinot Noir, well-made Merlot, Beaujolais Nouveau). But where it really gets interesting is figuring out flavor pairings. If you've got a hearty cornbread-and-sausage stuffing , you'll want to go with something funky and red that can stand up to it, like a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Rioja wine from Spain. If it's oyster-based , you'll want a minerally, crisp white, like a Sauvignon Blanc. Step aside, Obi-Wan and Darth Vader. The classic battle of good versus evil is now the stuff of celebrity food personalities. Anthony Bourdain and Eric Ripert have teamed up with master chocolatier Christopher Curtin to create the \"Good & Evil\" chocolate bar .  We tasted it. Let's see if it's worth its weight in cocoa butter by breaking it down into its component parts: When we heard the Downtown Cookie Co.'s cookie of the month for November was a Stuffing Cookie, we were skeptical. Can you blame us? Stuffing belongs at the dinner table, not on the dessert menu. Or so we thought. It turns out that adding stuffing to your cookies can result in a subtle and welcome savory note. Downtown Cookie Co. tested a variety of stuffings before ending on Pepperidge Farm for their recipe. We think it has less to do with the brand and more to do with choosing a stuffing that's loaded with herbs. The end result reminded us of an oatmeal cookie, with a hint of herbs and loaded with cranberries. Have you ever been in a bar and found yourself shocked to learn that a mixed drink was twelve or thirteen bucks? Well hold on to your liquor-soaked, hats because a world-renowned mixologist has just created a drink that costs over 700 times that. That's a lot of beer nuts. Celebrated drink-maker Salvatore Calabrese put together the beverage as part of London's cocktail week. He is calling it Salvatore's Legacy Cocktail and the price clocks in at a whopping $8,500. That's about the cost of a sensible used car or around a full year's salary for a lowly food blogger (Hey, wait a minute.) To say that our first employee, Maria, is a fan of the Victorian era is a bit of an understatement. Her email address includes the phrase \"veryvictorianlady,\" and for a time in her life, she penned and performed Victorian murder mysteries on an upstate N.Y. tourist train. If you happen to be wearing a high-necked blouse with lace on it, she is your immediate best friend. She has been the driving force behind the Sharon Springs Victorian Celebration that the village hosts on the first Saturday of every December. The only thing that she doesn't like about the Victorian era is the food. This time of year, the choice is almost always a difficult one between apple and pumpkin . Before the debate reaches a fever pitch, we've decided to settle this dispute of seasonal sweets once and for all by pitting the competition against each other. The holiday season evokes longings for warm spices, whether in pumpkin pie or hot mulled cider. Turn your attention to a unique way to get your spice fix: Alie and Georgia's 5-Spice on Ice cocktail uses a blend of freshly crushed cloves, cinnamon, star anise, fennel and Sichuan peppercorns infused in a simple syrup. The cocktail also gets a kick of intricate flavors from spiced rum, Angostura bitters and a muddled kumquat. Finally the cocktail is topped with a splash of fernet , an aromatic spirit made from cardamom, chamomile and saffron. It all makes for a deeply spiced drink that will pique your taste buds. Sometimes science comes up with convenient and necessary leaps forward in the world of food technology. Imagine your life without the microwave oven, the refrigerator or even the home coffee maker. Other times, however, science comes up with stuff that makes great water cooler talk but is essentially useless. Check out this ridiculously convoluted popcorn maker. It slices. It dices. Wait, it does none of that stuff. It just makes popcorn in the coolest, and most inconvenient, way possible. Think of it as the Rube Goldberg machine of popcorn makers. Did we mention it only pops one kernel at a time? If you time it right, you can have a bowl ready a few hours after the movie is finished. You see, throughout my entire life, my mother has been responsible for preparing the stuffing for our Thanksgiving meal, a prized recipe passed down from my grandmother. And while a love of cooking might have skipped a generation, my mom masters that stuffing, year after year, striking the perfect balance between moist, aromatic and crispy. So it seemed wrong to try to recreate it myself -- or even to ask for the recipe. We all like to smell good. Not only does it keep us popular wi"}

Connecting with other players appears to be a process akin to winning a latency-laden raffle. I've heard tales of people on the same network, even sitting in the same room, taking hours to meet up.  Not only that, but there is no penalty for using character trainers online. None. There's actually an invader with the name 'GFWL Souls ' who has the ability to slip into your session and murder key NPCs, changing from white phantom to red phantom at will, switching from saviour to killer in an instant.  The only option is to hit alt-F4 when you realise what's going on and hope you were quick enough. Emails to GFWL support might as well be letters to Santa.   If someone told me the whole setup was running on a modded fax machine I'd believe them. So I'm surprised when I press on a summon symbol and it works first time. A naked man with purple hair, clad only in a loincloth and wielding a greatsword appears.  I wish I could remember his username so you'd have fair warning if you summon him, but I can't, so I'll refer to him as Dickwraith. As soon as he's summoned, Dickwraith hares off round the corner. I struggle to follow as he beats a direct path to the boss gate. His nakedness means that he runs faster than my character, he also ignores the enemies, who decide to take it out on me as I follow in his wake. We head up a hill with an entourage of irked monsters in tow. Near the top, there's a narrow passage. Alone, I'd have inched in with my shield high, listening for any prelude to an assault. I'd soak up the atmosphere, let it burden me and paralyse me with a fear of danger and mistakes. Wary of being left behind, I plummet down the tunnel after him. We reach a fog gate. These are the partitions between the regular areas and the boss areas. These are the veil between sustained dread and full on concentrated horror. I stop and fiddle with my equipment. Dickwraith is restless. He twirls in a lazy circle and makes derisory gestures. He's done this before. I take a breath, adjust my grip on the controller, and step through. I won't describe the boss fight because that would spoil it for you like Dickwraith spoiled it for me. In short, though, he kills the boss in a couple of hits. He doesn't take any damage. The bosses' special attacks don't stagger him. He's a fucking hacker. Getting help from a hacker leaves me with mixed feelings. I'm used to being invaded by them, toyed with, then killed in an ignominious fashion, such as being beaten to death barehanded or inundated in toxic dung pies. I'd never summoned a hacker before and I can't tell whether Dickwraith's motivations were altruistic or malevolent. On one hand, he helped me with a boss fight I might have spent hours stuck on. On the other, he made a mockery of the caution that had typified my Dark Souls experience. He'd run naked over my immersion . Had I been meta trolled? This isn't a case of multiplayer ruining an experience. In fact, the concept of players traversing planes of reality to help or hinder each other is woven into the lore of the world: there are specific covenants for players to join that change the online experience, such as the Darkwraith covenant, which encourages PVP trolling, or the Sunbros, who endorse 'jolly cooperation' to the hilt and actively seek to help others. I see it as a missed opportunity for symbolism that Dickwraith wasn't masquerading as a Sunbro: he was regular white phantom. Having a buddy normally makes things easier, but it's no guarantee of success. Bosses gain health with each extra combatant, and for every skilled player I summon there'll be several who are just as clueless as I am. That's fine, though, it brings a sense of camaraderie. They've made the same journey as me. They've crept through the same hellscapes, fought the same monsters, and dodged the same traps. They, I hope, have died just as often as me. Even in the rare times I've been invaded and murdered by a non-hacker, I can still respect that they've worked hard to create the character they're backstabbing me with. They've earned their right to fuck with people. Lordran is a desolate place and any shared experience, even a deadly one, reminds me that I'm not as alone as it often seems.  I'm aware that all games have cheats and cheaters, yet with this infiltration seems more personal. Jolly cooperation just isn't same if your companion is an invincible hacker with juiced stats. I feel like a cheater by association. All I had to do was stay out of the way; I was simply following in the hacker's wake. The illusion of Dark Souls, the supernatural dread, had been diminished, exposing the reality of programming and numbers.  The feeling has never really left me: when I'm most frustrated, when an area seems impossible, there's the knowledge that I could go online and whack my stats up to 99. It's an easy te"}

The actress's observations in a New York Times interview this month sparked controversy, when she seemed to say she chose to be gay. Now the 45-year-old has said it was within the scope of her bisexuality that she decided to enter a gay relationship, rather than switching at will between exclusively gay and straight sexual orientations. She reiterated that her comments only applied to her, not the gay community in general. Nixon and Christine Marinoni have been together for nine years and went public with their relationship in 2004. She has two children from a former 15-year relationship with a man. Nixon's statement in full reads: \"My recent comments in The New York Times were about me and my personal story of being gay. I believe we all have different ways we came to the gay community and we can't and shouldn't be pigeon-holed into one cultural narrative which can be uninclusive and disempowering. However, to the extent that anyone wishes to interpret my words in a strictly legal context I would like to clarify: \"While I don't often use the word, the technically precise term for my orientation is bisexual. I believe bisexuality is not a choice, it is a fact. What I have 'chosen' is to be in a gay relationship. \"As I said in the Times and will say again here, I do, however, believe that most members of our community -- as well as the majority of heterosexuals -- cannot and do not choose the gender of the persons with whom they seek to have intimate relationships because, unlike me, they are only attracted to one sex. \"Our community is not a monolith, thank goodness, any more than America itself is. I look forward to and will continue to work toward the day when America recognizes all of us as full and equal citizens.\" Pink News covers religion, politics, entertainment, finance, and community news for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered community in the UK and worldwide.

HOW EVER!! we have got in a few parts... Such as THE FULLY SICK TURBRO!!!! its a T3-4 from china... its nothing special but will work nicely for this car to begin with. also got the tail shaft loop in and a few other goodies... we will be working on Bazza 2.0 tomorrow and first off getting a seat as the drivers on was rooted. Mat and i got alot done today. while we were trying to get the heater box out... we worked out the dash would of had to come out... So we decided to just rip out the hole dash and just leave the metal frame with the dash cluster... LOOKS AWESOME. oh and we finally got a drivers seat to replace the old one as it was all broken up. i had a look at the turbo yesterday and found it has a lil issue due to postage.... the waste gate actuator ports were almost busted off. contacted them with the issue and they are sending out another waste gate actuator to replace it, Great service also got the tail shaft loop on the car and did a few other smaller things. also had the competition rock up today un invited to scope out our car. hid the turbo from site and just made it look like we hadnt really done much.. LOL he thinks hes gonna beat up with his VN wagon. if i can ill get some pics of his nugget of a car. Nice work Rob, shame about the WG but at least they're sending out a new one. I'll be very curious to see how the cheapie ebay turbo goes... Generally they either go really well, or really badly. Hopefully it'll be enough to get you through at least a few burnouts ----------------------------------------\\\\... Wondering what happened to the Mighty Mira? Check out the (continued) build Here ----------------------------------------\\\\... Mat sent me some pics of the Competition. this is the car we are going up against. Woody use to be a mate of mine and owned 1 third of the original Bazza but we had a falling out. Anyway He bought a white VN commodore Wagon.... kinda freaky that we both bought white wagons... so what woods has done is got a T4 trubo from a Dump truck and instead of putting it under the bonnet like a noraml person... he is placing it at the back of the car where the spare tire would normally sit and having the intake pipes going through the cabin Flanged through the fire wall and into the engine... Here are a few pics. the front of the nugget... notice the BAKEON number plates... The engine... he has put copper head gaskets on it and converted it to gas... only issue is he is only running one gas converter for a turboed engine... gonna be running real lean on gas. Where the intake piping from the turbo goes through the fire wall... using the fire wall as a gasket... Fail Nice welding on the intake piping there thats going through the cabin... Now this guy is a Fully qualified mechanic ( a terrible one at that ). other fail mods is the diff has been welded up.... through the inspection hole... not properly. the oil feed line for the turbo go from the oil pressure gauge port all the way to the back of the car and then all the way back to the sump where he has a pump on the return line that is very powerfull it will just suck all the oil out of the turbo and kill it. oh and not to mention he is covering the turbo in the spare wheel well with the piece of wood that noramlly covers the spare wheels.. so when it gets hot it will burn quite nicely along with the gas tank that will be bolted right next to it... So mat and i are hoping its not going to get through Scrutineering. but if it does... it will not last long LOL A turbo in the back of the car? You have to be kidding! Stupiest car mod I've heard in a while!!! WTF! There's just so much wrong with such a setup!! Airflow, Oil lines, HEAT FFS (burnouts will cause serious heat) and the length of the lines - i.e. pressure loss. GAH what a tool. I feel sorry for the poor people who own the car's that he's worked on and probably ruining.... A turbo in the back of the car? You have to be kidding! Stupiest car mod I've heard in a while!!! WTF!

The Reflective CIO - So you want to be a CIO? Welcome to my premiere blog post. The theme is \"The Reflective CIO\" for those who have considered the question: \"I want to be a CIO?\". I will present views based on my own observations and first hand experiences. Over a 15 year period, across multiple organisations, my own CIO roles have been quite diverse. This includes very large public sector ICT environments in both NZ and Australia. I've driven rapid transformation of ICT services, reinvented an organisation using Business Process Reengineering (BPR), leveraged ICT to transform business operations, commissioned data centres, and managed all facets of ICT operations, projects, strategy and architecture and stakeholder relationship management. Acting as a change agent and a change protagonist has been a common feature throughout my CIO career. I see leading change as a prerequisite quality for a CIO. Being a CIO has presented me with many challenges. Many of these are as relevant today as they have always been and include: How to be seen to reduce ICT costs without sacrificing service levels How to improve business and ICT relationships and collaboration; How to bring a commercial focus to public service ICT; How to refresh capability and right-size ICT. Plus there are many more and I will eventually cover them all in upcoming posts. Through these experiences I have gained a damn good education as the top ICT decision maker in several excellent organisations. This is an education I am happy to pass on, to fast track your own path, and improve the practice of the Chief Information Officer. To get started, I have outlined my retrospective CIO wisdom to serve as food for thought. In doing so, consider what type of CIO you are, or would you want to be? We all have our strengths and weaknesses. And yours, just like mine, mean that you will be better suited to some challenges than others, and will best solve these challenges in your own way. As you ponder this, consider these, the things in my view that will never change: 1. You will need dogged determination if you are to succeed as a CIO I rate 'dogged determination' as the number one prerequisite attribute for a CIO. The lyrics: \"I get knocked down, but I get up again\" come ringing in my ears like a resounding anthem. You have an undeniable duty to take your organisation on a journey. That journey may involve smooth sailing or, more likely, a rough crossing through unchartered waters. 2. Should the Business drive ICT or should ICT drive the business? Current technology trends include the needs to navigate through the cloud, embrace (or contain) social media and exploit Big Data. In the past, equivalent evolutions might have included such things as: client server technologies, ERP and wireless networks. At the same time CIOs need to be intimately connected to the business with their fingers on the pulse, formulating approaches to help differentiate the business in the market, support operational improvements, or help protect market share from companies or products that didn't even exist last month. it is clear that ICT is indeed driving every business, many markets and whole industries. Technology and business challenges are irrefutably and increasingly linked and paradigm shifts will continue to emerge. But one thing should always remain constant. All ICT should always be approached from the business perspective. 3. Success will be measured through the eyes of your customers Achieving 99.9% server availability alone doesn't cut it anymore. In fact such service levels will be assumed and organisations will look to source such guarantees over the cloud. Only end to end service availability counts. That includes the servers, the applications, the structured and unstructured data and records, the web services, the networks and the tools that bind them all together. Add the business processes and the performance of staff and the value chain is complete. Ultimately it's about the number of repeat orders, the number of referrals and/or the value and volume of sales. It's about the utilisation of assets, the return on investment and the value of shareholder earnings. In short, it's not about technology at all. ICT organisations will need to significantly redefine themselves if they are to have relevance. New value propositions need to be devised and new business models need to be created to ensure your organisation is gaining the value from ICT that it will need not only to survive, but to prosper. 4. You're only as good as the team you lead ICT in a large and complex organisation generally extends well beyond the capacity of even the most seasoned CIO. Inevitably the CIO's role must elevate to that of a 'Lead CIO' with 'trusted advisors' taking their places as Subject Area CIOs -- example subject areas could be Strategy/Architecture, Portfolios, Programs and Projects, Capability Development & Sourcing, Service Delivery, Relationshi"}

Shortly after Peter died, Jerusalem was destroyed and many Christians fled to Pella, while others fled to Asia Minor. The Apostle John ended up living in the city of Ephesus in Asia Minor. John may have outlived Peter by over 30 years. Here is some of what The Catholic Encyclopedia records about John and his travels, John was the son of Zebedee and Salome, and the brother of James the Greater. In the Gospels the two brothers are often called after their father \"the sons of Zebedee\" and received from Christ the honourable title of Boanerges, i.e. \"sons of thunder\" (Mark 3:17). Originally they were fishermen and fished with their father in the Lake of Genesareth... Apparently John in common with the other Apostles remained some twelve years in this first field of labour, until the persecution of Herod Agrippa I led to the scattering of the Apostles through the various provinces of the Roman Empire (cf. Acts 12:1-17). Notwithstanding the opinion to the contrary of many writers, it does not appear improbable that John then went for the first time to Asia Minor and exercised his Apostolic office in various provinces there... He returned with the other disciples to Jerusalem for the Apostolic Council (about A.D. 51). St. Paul in opposing his enemies in Galatia names John explicitly along with Peter and James the Less as a \"pillar of the Church\", and refers to the recognition which his Apostolic preaching of a Gospel free from the law received from these three, the most prominent men of the old Mother-Church at Jerusalem (Galatians 2:9). When Paul came again to Jerusalem after the second and after the third journey (Acts 18:22; 21:17 sq.) he seems no longer to have met John there. Some wish to draw the conclusion from this that John left Palestine between the years 52 and 55... Both the Epistles and the Apocalypse, however, presuppose that their author John belonged to the multitude of personal eyewitnesses of the life and work of Christ (cf. especially 1 John 1:1-5; 4:14), that he had lived for a long time in Asia Minor, was thoroughly acquainted with the conditions existing in the various Christian communities there, and that he had a position of authority recognized by all Christian communities as leader of this part of the Church. Moreover, the Apocalypse tells us that its author was on the island of Patmos \"for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus\", when he was honoured with the heavenly Revelation contained in the Apocalypse (Revelation 1:9)... John was not only the last of the apostles to die, he was also the last writer of any of the books of the New Testament. John is mentioned in all the other Gospel accounts, plus several of the epistles. We also specifically have five books of the Bible (The Gospel according to John, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, and the Apocalypse/Revelation) written by John. Martin Luther liked John's Gospel account so much that he wrote, \"The first three speak of the works of our Lord, rather than His oral teachings; that of St. John is the only sympathetic, the only true Gospel and should undoubtedly be preferred above the others. In like manner the Epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul are superior to the first three Gospels \" (O'Hare PF. The Facts About Luther, 1916--1987 reprint ed., p. 203). And though Martin Luther's position on this, and some of his other matters, appear to be blasphemous and in contraction to II Timothy 3:16, it does show the value he placed on some of John's work. John wrote what is perhaps the most famous passage in the entire New Testament, John 3:16 which says: For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life (NKJV throughout, unless otherwise indicated). John wrote a lot about love, with the next passages as some of the more famous ones from his Gospel account: A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another (John 13:34-35). If you love Me, keep My commandments (John 14:15). He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me (John 14:24). \"As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full. This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends. You are My frien"}

Entitled Away From The World , this album was highly anticipated by Dave Matthews Band fans, as it is the first studio in which the late Leroi Moore does not appear. Moore passed away half way through the recording of the band's seventh studio album, Big Whiskey and The GrooGrux King, changing the dynamics of the band altogether. However, do not fret, as this album is highly reminiscent of the Dave Matthews Band from the mid-1990's, clearly influenced by Grammy award winning producer Steve Lillywhite. Lillywhite produced DMB's first three studio albums, ending with the 1998 best selling album Before These Crowded Streets as well as the famously unreleased but vastly leaked album The Lillywhite Sessions , which is still known to be the band's rawest, darkest studio recordings. Away From The World provides a conglomerate of the earlier storytelling jams of the Dave Matthews Band with the newer uplifting pop-folk funk that the band began experimenting with during the new millennium. On a lyrical sense, the songs of Away From The World reflect a different, more hopeful Dave Matthews Band then previously Lillywhite-produced albums. Dave sings about saving the world on several of the tracks, including their single for the album, \"Mercy\", depicting Dave Matthews in a much different light from the heroin and alcohol abuse he once sang about. Dave Matthews Band and Steve Lillywhite perfectly combined the band's live-jam talents into a studio recorded song with \"Gaucho\", using several bridges to create a 4 minute 25 second song full of slow tempos picked up by engaging saxophone/trumpet solos, followed by light acoustic guitar and folk-rock singing, only to be once again raised to a whirlwind of energy via Boyd Tinsley's Fiddle Solos. The song finishes off with vocal distortions by Dave Matthews and a choir of children singing, \"We gotta do much more than believe if we want to see the world change.\" And of course, the Dave Matthews Band stayed true to form, creating an album including various love songs. Track 8, \"If Only\", stands out as an impeccably written love song, providing sensual high notes through guitar solos by the amazing Tim Reynolds, a slow and steady bass line, light subtle drumming, and an oh so smooth saxophone solo and keyboard jam in the foreground to top it all off. It is somewhat reminiscent of \"Dreamgirl\" from 2005?s Stand Up . Away From The World , in its entirety, combines the genres of sound that the Dave Matthews Band has created throughout their past 7 albums, into one sole album. Almost as if it's a tribute to their greatest hits, proving the band's abilities to create a range of music, the second track on the album, \"Belly Belly\" is reminiscent of the funky jams of Everyday, with horns blasting and a funk bass line, as played by Stefan Lessard, slapping its way throughout the track. \"Mercy\" provides an eerie yet magical Tim Reynolds solo, against light, soulful twelve string acoustic guitar just as Dave Matthews' song \"Oh\" did on Some Devil. \"Belly Full\" has strong folk influences, while \"Snow Outside\" has heavy bluegrass influences yet on a slower tempo. \"Sweet\", the fifth track on Away From the World , demonstrates a blend of musical styles, featuring a light mandolin riff against Dave's exploration of various octaves of singing. The most original song on the album is the ninth track, \"Rooftop\". It provides strong minor bass chords with heavy fast tempo drumming, creating a heavier rock influenced song. Every instrument, from the fiddle to the trumpet, will blast through your speakers at once. The Dave Matthews Band is know to showcase each of their instruments on a solo and individual level, allowing this track to provide a very redeeming element of surprise and individuality on the album. It ends with a long jam and the sound of footsteps, where Jeff Coffin's saxophone skills blend into a melody reminiscent of \"The Stone\" reprise from Before These Crowded Streets . If this wasn't enough of a clear influence by Steve Lilywhite, (who is known to edit in subtle band-speak and white noise recordings from the studio sessions) the final track on the album, \"Drunken Soldier\" combines various genres of music played by the band into one final track. Starting off with Bluegrass elements and subtle speaking in the background, the 9-minute 45-minute track progresses into Santana style Spanish guitar rhythms, heavy horns, and electric guitar solos, followed by heavily instrumental moments to solos of each of the band's featured instruments. It is a fitting ending track to an album sampling different musical influences and styles. Ultimately, I do recommend Dave Matthews Band's Away From the World . Although I miss the originality and raw, angry emotion and overdrawn jamming of the early days of DMB, the"}

Politics permeates every aspect of life in Washington, DC, but in the week that America goes to the polls the all-consuming fervour hits fever-pitch. While getting a pass for a White House tour is sadly no longer an option for visiting Brits (a temporary state of affairs, we hope), there are still plenty of worthwhile ways for the average citizen to immerse themselves in the political process. We've outlined a few of the most significant sites and tours below... The United States Capitol Learn about the process by which Congress makes laws, declares war, approves presidential appointments and raises public money on a free tour of the United States Capitol . Inside what is one of the world's most recognisable seats of power, you will visit the Crypt of the Capitol, the Rotunda, and the National Statuary Hall while learning about America's struggle to establish the world's first truly representative democracy. Separate passes are required to tour the galleries of the Senate and House of Representatives Chambers, which are open to visitors whenever either legislative body is in session. International visitors should inquire about gallery passes at the House and Senate Appointment Desks on the upper level of the Capitol Visitor Center. Although there are a limited number of same-day tour passes available at the Capitol Visitor Centre each day, you must book your United States Capitol tour in advance of your trip to guarantee a space. The Supreme Court The United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and comprises the Chief Justice of the United States and a number of Associate Justices as set by Congress, currently fixed at eight. Only the President can nominate Justices, and appointments are made with the consent and advice of the Senate. Once appointed, Justices remain in their positions for life, unless they resign, retire, or are impeached. Surprisingly, given the importance of its role as a branch of government, the Supreme Court did not have its own building until 1935, after previously meeting in the 'Old Senate Chamber' in the Capitol Building. It was the former President Taft -- who was Chief Justice at the time -- who persuaded Congress to authorise the construction of a permanent home for the court, though he never lived to see it completed. Today, you can visit the classical Corinthian-style building on a self-guided tour and, if in session, even attend Courtroom oral arguments on a first-come, first-served basis. The National Archives The National Archives is the ultimate destination for United States history buffs. On display inside this building are the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights and the U.S Constitution, which are housed in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom . Within the Public Vaults -- the permanent exhibit of the National Archives Experience -- are original records and documents, from fascinating letters to the President, to the telegrams of Abraham Lincoln and the handwritten letters of George Washington. The Lawrence F. O'Brien Gallery displays temporary exhibitions on matters of political significance. On the Brink: JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis has just opened and runs until February 2013. The Pentagon The United States Department of Defense headquarters are located in Arlington County, Virginia. The five-sided Pentagon is the world's largest office building, with its own subway station, 16 car parks, 200 acres of lawns and some 17.5 miles of corridors; a virtual city employing roughly 23,000 civilian and military personnel. Explore the mission of the Department of Defense and its service branches, and see noteworthy displays highlighting significant moments in US military history on a guided tour, which lasts approximately 90 minutes. British citizens no longer need to arrange this via the British Embassy, and can now book directly with the Pentagon Tours website. Tours are free but must be reserved in advance. The Pentagon, Arlington County, Virginia. Take Metrorail to the Pentagon stop.

I am an unwilling spy, forced to blend in to a role that I am honestly horrible in. You see, my body is male, but don't let that fool you because I am not a man. In my twenty-six years of life, I have never been anything other than female. I don't know what it's like to one of the guys, to be a devoted boyfriend, or be anything other than myself -- no matter how much I desired it. I stumbled through life listlessly, unable to form goals because I was denying something so core to myself. It all started at the beginning of April in 2010. I was sitting in the Quarry of the student union. It was a basement outfitted with a bunch of neon lights on the ceiling and a small stage. It looked a lot like that hangout the kids went to from Saved by the Bell . That horrible 1980s look, even though it was just remodeled a few years ago. People usually used it as a cafeteria during the day, though. Students buzzed with excitement around me, but I just sat there with my laptop open staring at the university's counseling center's website. This wasn't working anymore. I knew that something needed to change. Putting only a meager amount of effort into my classes was catching up with me as the difficulty increased. It wasn't that I didn't want to try more, but trying to concentrate on something creative like graphic design while depressed was almost impossible. Was I afraid? Was I angry? I was just numb. A numbness that tingled on the back of my skull and made my eyes felt hollow and lifeless. It placed a scowl on my lips and made my hair dry and limp. I just didn't care anymore -- that was what scared me most. I was so scared that I turned to the one person I thought I could: my sister, Jenny. Limply, I pulled out my cell phone and found her number in my address book. As I waited, I went through all of the possible things I could say to her. I thought about how I would begin telling her everything. Dull tingles of fear poked at my toes as I heard the click of her picking up. \"I need to tell you something,\" I said, skipping any needless greetings. There was a pause before Jenny asked, \"What's wrong? You sound upset.\" Was I upset? Is that how I sounded? I wasn't sure. \"I can't do this anymore.\" \"I think I know what's coming.\" I heard her sigh over the phone. She knew what was coming? Really? There was no way that she could see this coming. I sat there in silence for well over a minute before I heard her clear her throat. I felt sick. My stomach was churning and the world was dimming around me. Before I knew it, the words were coming out of me. \"For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to be a girl.\" As soon as the words were out, there wasn't any way to take them back. Something warm and wet was running down my cheeks. Tears of relief and bitterness combined with an odd, refreshing coolness in my chest. Finally, Jenny said, \"I... I thought it was something like that. I just thought that you might be gay because you act so feminine, but I had no idea it went that far.\" Looking back to my laptop's screen, I said, \"I'm thinking of going to the university's counseling center to get help -- I'm...not in the best shape right now. I'm not sure I want to live anymore.\" \"That's a good idea. You should get help right away.\" She waited a moment, I was out of things to say. \"Tim,\" she said. The dreaded t-word. \"You know that we care about you, right? Please don't hurt yourself.\" I gave a mumble and hung up. Folding my arms on the table in front of me, I leaned forward and rested my chin on my forearm, staring at the contact section of the website. Fuck! I sat up and dialed the number. \"Hi, I'd like to make an appointment. I need help...\" Two weeks later, I was riding in my dad's truck with him and my mother. I didn't tell them what the sessions with Dr. Walker were about these last few weeks; likewise, I didn't tell them what today was about either, but I did tell them that I needed to tell them something. A few times, my mom turned to look at me in the backseat and asked, \"If there's something you need to tell us, you know that you can, right?\" Her dark blue eyes were staring at me, her lip twitching with worry. She had short, brown hair. She was a short but intimidating woman. An aura stretched off of her body that let everyone know that she would not be putting up with any of their crap. An admirable trait, but a trait that often got her into trouble -- this trait that is also genetic. My father just stared at the road ahead of him. I got my brown eyes from him, I could see them in the rearview mirror. He wasn't wearing one of his usual, worn-out baseball caps. Instead, you could see his white-gray hair in all of its aged awe. It grew more wispy toward the back like snow blowing off the top of a summit. I could tell he was just as worried as Mom because he was just staring at the road ahead. He usually looked around and it made me nervous. I thought back to all the times my mom asked, \"Is the"}

Burrow toppled young Brazilian Gabriel Medina (BRA), 18, and goofy-footer Travis Logie (ZAF), 33, en route to the Final against compatriot Wilkinson. Both Burrow and Wilkinson opened up strongly, but struggled to secure a solid backup score. Wilkinson had an opportunity in the dying moments, but couldn't hold on during a third critical maneuver and came up just short. \"This win feels incredible,\" Burrow said. \"It happens sometimes where you never feel like you have the best heats. I was kind of in the zone. I never really had a good heat the whole event, but I still felt good. It's such a tricky wave and I guess the only thing that helped was my wave count. That Final was the battle of the back-ups. We both stacked it on a couple and we were in a fluster. Wilko (Matt Wilkinson) fell on that last one and he would have got the score, but I'll take it.\" Burrow's win marks his second of the season after snatching the opening event on the Gold Coast of Australia. Western Australia's favorite son now sits at No. 6 on the 2012 ASP WCT rankings. \"I really wanted to win another event this year, especially since I'm out of the race for the title,\" Burrow said. \"That's pretty depressing, but I'm really happy that it just fell in to place here in Santa Cruz. To get two wins in a year, I've only done that once before so I'm really happy with that.\" Wilkinson, a former winner at the venue in 2010, continued his lethal backhand assault at Steamer Lane, belting the day's highest heat total of 17.73 while defeating Adriano de Souza (BRA), 25, and Michel Bourez (PYF), 26, to attain his first ASP WCT Final appearance. \"I was stoked when I made it through the third round,\" Wilkinson said. \"Every heat after that, I just kept building. I felt amazing. I was getting 9s and backing them up. All year I've been dropping one big score. Out here, I felt like I was getting better every heat. I had that one that would have been a 9 if I made it out of that last turn.\" Wilkinson was in desperate need of a result entering the O'Neill Coldwater Classic ranked 30th on the ASP WCT rankings. \"I was starting to freak out,\" Wilkinson said. \"I didn't want it to be left up to Hawaii needing points. Anything can happen there. There's a bunch of locals in the contest so it's not like any other event. You have to surf more rounds than usual and the more down the list you are the harder it is because you have to surf more rounds. I'm definitely happy to have these points heading in to Hawaii.\" Today's Runner-Up finish vaults Wilkinson up to 22nd on the ASP WCT rankings and 15th on the ASP World Rankings, solidifying his requalification position for the 2013 ASP Top 34. Michel Bourez (PYF), 26, marched to his best result of the year, besting veteran Damien Hobgood (USA), 33, and Jeremy Flores (FRA), 24, with an amazing array of powerful carving turns on his forehand. Unfortunately for the Tahitian, he was unable to put a stop to Wilkinson's progressive backhand approach in the Semifinals and finished Equal 3rd overall. \"It was a good event for more,\" Bourez said. \"I'm frustrated that I didn't have a better Semifinal. I feel like I haven't had the best year and I was having a good event this week. My son is here with me and my family is my life. They have been my inspiration this week.\" Travis Logie (ZAF), 33, was another deadly backhander at Steamer Lane, besting current ASP WCT rankings' leader Joel Parkinson (AUS), 31, in the Quarterfinals while securing his best result of 2012, an Equal 3rd place finish. Logie's tear continued in the Semifinals, posting an excellent 8.33 against Taj Burrow, but the South African was unable to find a backup score against the Australian, finishing just shy of the Final. \"I'm pretty stoked with how I surfed in this event,\" Logie said. \"I'm really disappointed because I had one really good one in that heat and I feel like I just needed an average one to make that heat. Taj has been ripping though and congratulations to him.\" Logie, who entered the O'Neill Coldwater Classic ranked 26th, vaults up the rankings to 17th, compliments of his 3rd place finish in Santa Cruz, revitalizing his campaign to requalify for the 2013 ASP WCT. \"This result is huge for me,\" Logie said. \"These points are massive. I was looking pretty out of it going in to this event and a third place here shoots me quite a bit up the rankings. I'm still not home and dry, but hopefully in Hawaii I can make up some points.\" Kelly Slater (USA), 40, current ASP WCT No. 2, struggled to find a rhythm in his Round 4 bout against Adriano de Souza, finishing equal 9th overall. Despite Slater's early exit from the event, a 9th place finish replaces his last-place injury points from Brazil, exponentially narrowing the ratings' gap with current frontrunner, Park"}

In our present secular society highly critical of the institutional Church, it is timely to recall another era when the Catholic Church was 'under siege' -- from sectarianism rather than secularism -- and was served actively and faithfully not just by clerics and religious, but by a committed, influential and farsighted Catholic laity. Indeed the Church in Melbourne at the turn of the 20th century had established a productive and radical collaboration between clergy and laity which served it well. Fr Duffy wryly remarks that, 'Some of the questions raised then about the place and role of religion in secular society remain with us still.' Perhaps some indications of the role the laity might play in the present situation could be gleaned from this 'splendid work of scholarship and historical interest'. It's true, I think, that for many people the history of the Catholic Church in Melbourne really began with the coming of Archbishop Mannix. He led the archdiocese for nearly fifty years; he was a commanding presence; and the Church here was closely identified with him. Some would hold that what preceded his reign was rather like a curtain-raiser to the main event. But as Patrick Morgan demonstrates in his important new book, that is a flawed view. With his very impressive research he shows that in the pre-Mannix era clerical and lay activists together developed what he calls 'a vibrant Catholic culture' (1), and they played a significant part in the development of the broader social and political life of the Victorian colony. Histories of this earlier period (1880-1920) tell the story of the Church's extraordinary expansion, as it tried to meet the needs of the rapidly growing Catholic population. They describe a church creating its great networks of parish churches, schools, friendly societies, hospitals, charity organisations, as well as its social, sporting and adult education associations. But by and large those histories are accounts of what the clergy -- bishops and priests -- did. Little was said about the lay people's contribution. But as we follow Patrick's narrative we find that several notable lay leaders, together with the clergy, made very significant contributions to the founding and leadership of important church organisations, and were informed and vigorous participants in public discussion of the major social and socio-religious issues of the time. In the decades before this period, two Catholics became leaders of the colonial government and one other led the government in the first years of the period studied here. The book brings to life the men and women of that era who established an astonishing range of publications -- local weekly papers like The Advocate and The Tribune, and periodicals like Austral Light, with their essays on the arts and literature and their discussions of social and religious issues. This was part of a general plan to keep Catholics informed on key issues of the day -- a kind of instrument for continuing education. In reading the profiles of these writers and editors one is struck by the range of their interests and the quality of their writings. One of the more notable of these was Marion Miller Knowles, a talented, versatile woman; a prolific journalist, poet and novelist, who helped found the Catholic Women's Association and was involved in many charitable and social causes. These writers and thinkers were supported and encouraged in their work by their clerical leaders, in a kind of lay-clerical collaboration which many years later the Second Vatican Council was to recommend to the worldwide church. Patrick brings his narrative and analytical skills to bear especially on his account of the major subjects of public controversy which engaged the local Catholic writers -- subjects like the Education Act of 1872 and state aid for Catholic schools; the place of Catholics in society and their relation to the various political parties; the coming of Federation; the conscription debates. And there was, of course, the continuing interest in the Irish question and Ireland's quest for Home Rule. These debates are set in the context of social and political events occurring at the time in Ireland, Britain, Australia and, on a few occasions, Rome. In this period there were sustained attempts to provide continuing or adult education through organisations like the Catholic Young Men's Society, and later there was the initiative to encourage Catholics to find their way into the world of the university and be at home there, through support systems like the Newman Society and later with the establishment of Newman College. On matters such as the place of the various religious groups in society and relations with political parties, the Catholic contributors helped the wider"}

A second night of rioting broke out across London last night, with violence erupting in several of the capital's boroughs, from Brixton in the south to Enfield and Islington in the north and Walthamstow in the east. The fresh unrest -- some of which appears to have been part of an orchestrated plan -- has so far resulted in 100 arrests. The latest rioting followed disturbances on Saturday night in Tottenham, north London, which came after the shooting by police of Mark Duggan, 29, on Thursday. Officers responding to sporadic disorder in a number of boroughs made more than 100 arrests throughout last night and early this morning. This is in addition to the 61 arrests made on Saturday night and Sunday morning.\" According to the statement, there have been 16 charges over offences including burglary, points and blades, theft and violent disorder. Seventeen people have been bailed and one has been cautioned. One person has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, 11 are awaiting CPS advice and 15 are ongoing inquiries. The statement concluded: Officers are shocked at the outrageous level of violence directed against them. At least nine officers were injured overnight in addition to the 26 injured on Saturday night. We will not tolerate this disgraceful violence. The investigation continues to bring these criminals to justice. 7.55am: The Labour MP and phone-hacking campaigner Tom Watson is at a loss to understand who's minding the shop as violence erupts in the capital. Just after 6pm on a mild Friday evening almost exactly 30 years ago, a young police constable inadvertently set in motion a wave of violent unrest that would, over the next three months, sweep through England's inner cities. The catalyst for the riot that would reshape national attitudes towards deprivation, race and policing was innocuous enough: on a busy street in Brixton, south London, PC Steve Margiotta tried to stop a frightened young black man who was bleeding profusely from a stab wound; he called for help when the youth ran away. Community relations were at an all-time low amid an aggressive police crackdown that had seen 943 people searched on the street in a few days, and a rumour spread that Margiotta had prevented the youth getting treatment and -- also incorrectly -- that he had died. Within half an hour an angry crowd was pelting Margiotta and his colleagues with bricks and bottles. Before the weekend was over, more than 350 police officers had been injured and about two dozen buildings were gutted by fires. By the end of 1981's summer of urban discontent, fuelled by mass unemployment and simmering resentment at oppressive, sometimes openly racist policing, similar scenes ravaged parts of Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. 8.07am: This is what the home secretary, Theresa May, has to say about the latest violence: Last night, police officers again put themselves in harm's way to protect Londoners and their property. \"Those responsible for the violence and looting will be made to face the consequences of their actions. Many have been arrested and further arrests will be made. \"Londoners have made clear that there are no excuses for violence, and I call on all members of local communities to work constructively with the police to help them bring these criminals to justice.\" 8.09am: Brixton residents are waking up to an ugly Monday morning and what one police officer has described as \"a mini-Tottenham\". Here's PA's report on the situation in south London: Several shops along the High Street, including WH Smith and McDonald's, had their windows smashed, and the Tube station was closed as officers diverted commuters during the morning rush-hour. Firefighters were inspecting the burned-out remains of Foot Locker, next to the station. Inside, the blackened building looked to have been completely destroyed, with only charred remains visible from he street. Police officers on the edge of a cordon in Brixton Road were directing hundreds of commuters to a nearby bus stop amid chaotic scenes. One local, Mark Bray, 38, an IT consultant, said: \"Police should have seen this coming. There was a festival here yesterday, it is no surprise with Brixton and all its history that the mood has turned sour. \"The looting is pretty pathetic, to be honest - it doesn't do anyone any favours.\" The cordon prevented hundreds of commuters from getting to the overground station, which remained open. 8.14am: Here's a little more on events last night in the north London borough of Islington -- which seem to have lacked the fury and violence of those elsewhere. According to the Met: In Islington there were reports of a group causing a disturbance and a police vehicle windscreen was smashed.\" 8.23am: There appears to be some confusion over what happened in Islington last night. Despite reports on Twitter that a police officer was dragged from his car and beaten -- and that I"}

In just about every speech at their 2008 convention, Democrats promised voters that a change in the White House would, in Barack Obama's formulation, restore \"our moral standing\" in the world. Replace the unilateralist cowboy at the top with a humbler multilateralist, and the path would finally be cleared to fix vexing international issues such as curbing carbon emissions and dealing with the mullahs in Iran. Like many of the party faithful's long-nurtured beliefs, this hope has disintegrated on contact with reality. \"America is losing the free world,\" said a January headline in the Financial Times . While that statement is exaggerated, the sentiment behind it has been gaining traction around the globe, especially in the wake of the climate conference debacle in Copenhagen. It's not just that the less confrontational American president has been unable to deliver results. He can't even get his phone calls returned. \"On the last day of the [Copenhagen] talks, the Americans tried to fix up one-to-one meetings between Mr Obama and the leaders of South Africa, Brazil and India -- but failed each time,\" Gideon Rachman wrote in the Financial Times piece. \"The Indians even said that their prime minister, Manmohan Singh, had already left for the airport. So Mr Obama must have felt something of a chump when he arrived for a last-minute meeting with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, only to find him already deep in negotiations with the leaders of none other than Brazil, South Africa and India.\" It was easy for many Democrats to believe, during the nightmare years of \"freedom fries,\" that George W. Bush alone was to blame for the diplomatic prickliness between, say, Washington and Paris. But the basic conditions for American foreign policy have more to do with America's outsized position in the world than with any particular politicians. Bill Clinton tangled constantly with the French, and now a visibly irritated President Nicolas Sarkozy has gone within a year from vying for Obama's attentions to taking (in the words of a competing politician) an openly \"anti-Obama position.\" Obama's approach was supposed to produce a more cooperative Tehran and Moscow, fewer terrorists in the Muslim world, and vast new initiatives to fight global poverty. Instead, Iran has murdered dissenters while speeding up its nuclear program, Russia hasn't discernibly budged even after the U.S. abandoned its missile shield in the Czech Republic and Poland, a Muslim suicide bomber was stopped at the last minute from blowing up a plane over Detroit on Christmas, and global gatherings have produced even less concrete action than usual. These developments illustrate a phenomenon that has been playing out across a variety of public policy areas: Progressive Democrats, after being outfoxed by Ronald Reagan, triangulated to the policy margins by Bill Clinton, then routed under the first six years of George W. Bush, are having many of the nostrums they championed during the wilderness years tested in the real world for the first time in decades. The initial results of this long-delayed peer review have been a shock to the progressive system. The Copenhagen crackup was a dream killer in more ways than one. Not only did the breakdown give the lie to the notion that a cranky Texas oilman was the single greatest impediment to international cooperation and enlightened environmental policy; it laid waste to the argument that yoking the developing world to a \"do as we say, not as we did\" policy of energy consumption will somehow prove to be an economic and environmental \"win-win.\" If that's true, the leaders of India and China -- the latter of which has been serially praised for its green-energy initiatives by the likes of New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman -- certainly don't believe it. No amount of international do-goodism is going to prevent countries from acting in what they perceive to be their own self-interest. Obama and the Democrats have been peddling a similar win-win line about the creation of up to 5 million \"green jobs\" in America, through a combination of cap-and-trade carbon permits, home weatherization, clean coal, higher gas mileage standards, environmental regulation, and various renewable-energy mandates. The \"green jobs\" political juggernaut has been credited to Van Jones, who was obliged to resign as Obama's \"Green Czar\" last summer after reports surfaced that he'd signed a petition supporting an investigation of Bush's involvement in 9/11. What's interesting about Jones' beautiful-sounding concept is that even its chief supporters admit there's no evidence the theory is true.

Now I get so many emails from adults wanting to start ballet. My advice is always the same - do it! But do it at the right level. I have experienced so many tearful post-class nights by doing things that are way beyond my level that I've literally lost count. Sure, it's good to try everything, even if you don't succeed, but it's also good to have victories every once in a while. One of the best ballet experiences I ever had, was repeating a Beginners Level II class at Scottish Ballet. I had done the class before, but there was no classes aimed at my experience level at that time - not beginner but not yet intermediate - so, I signed up for the Beginners Level II class again. I had also been going to an intermediate level class which, at that time, was quite a bit above my head, but it did improve my coordination and technique. So when I went back into the beginners class, I actually could relax as much of what we were doing was well and truly engrained in my brain now, having done that and much harder stuff at intermediate level in the other class, and I loved the experience of just being able to do it with relative ease. It felt freeing. It was a small, but wonderful, victory. So, really, what I'm saying is don't make the same mistakes I made. Don't be hard on yourself. Learn slowly and learn steadily. It will come. It might not feel like it, but it will happen. Ballet takes patience and time. Lots and lots of time. Be dedicated, work hard at whatever level you are at and ballet will become part of who you are in no time. As as a side note, for anyone in Glasgow who wants to start ballet at the beginning, Dance HQ is now starting a Beginners level class and our open class is now changing to Intermediate level class. The new beginners class commences on Tuesday 6th March. Comments Begin At The Beginning Going into ballet as a beginner can be terrifying.

But of course he'd still know how to treat a lady right, this is a rough tough gentleman 's pie after all. The mixture of steak, Guinness and seriously strong cheese make the most incredible, rich pie filling, while the pastry is the perfect buttery, crispy, soft vessel for all that gravy. I make this for my dad and brothers for brownie points (but really I make it for me as it's my absolute favourite). The only thing that's a little bit tricky about this recipe is the pastry. I make Leith's Rough Puff Pastry but you could always speed things up a bit by buying really good ready made puff pastry. I like to make my pie filling the day before I make my pie. This way it has all night to mingle and get delicious in the fridge. It's also much better for baking the pastry, we don't want any soggy bottoms. Add a glug of olive oil to a large saucepan over a medium heat. Once it's hot toss in your onions. Fry until soft and then add your carrots, parsnips, mushrooms and garlic. Mix it all together before adding your beef, salt, pepper and rosemary. Turn the heat up a bit and fry it all together for about 5mins. When the meat's gotten a little colour, add your flour and pour in your Guinness. Simmer for a few mins before covering and throwing the whole thing in the oven. Leave it bubbling away for at least 2 hours, stirring now and then. This is going to make your kitchen smell awesome . After about 2 hours remove your pot and put it back on the hob without its lid to reduce the sauce. When you're left with a pretty robust, thick sauce, you should be done. Put the filling to one side to cool down and then pop it in the fridge over night. The most important thing with pastry is to keep everything as cold as possible. Open the windows, hold your hands under the cold tap and dry them and clear a mixing bowl sized space in the fridge before you start. Sift your flour and salt into a large bowl. Using a table knife, toss the butter cubes with the flour. Sprinkle about 12 tablespoons of water over the flour while stirring quickly with your table knife so that the paste clumps together. Now use your fingertips to Gather the lumps together, leaving any dry mixture in the bottom of the bowl. It will look hideous. Flour your surface and mould your dough into a rectangle. Now start rolling it out. (I used a marble rolling pin but you could always use a cold (dry) wine bottle, just remember to cover it in flour first.) Roll it out so it is 3 times as long as it is wide. Fold it over itself like you would do with a business letter. Press the edges of the pastry gently, like a gentle judo chop (to seal the air inside). Turn it around so it looks like a closed book you are about to open. Do this again and again until your pastry starts to look smooth like this. Now fold it up again, cover with one of your butter wrappers and pop it in the fridge. It needs at least an hour, or you could leave it over night like I did. When you're ready, you'll need to divide your pastry into bottom and lid. Pop your oven onto 190C/375F while you're at it. Your lid should be just under a third of the dough. Mmmm... look at all that butter... Put your lid to one side and roll out your bottom. It needs to be big enough to cover the inside of your pie dish and not too thin. Use your fingers and a little bit of water to wet the rim of your pie dish under the edges of your pastry so it sticks. Then cut off the excess pastry and put it to one side (you can use this to make your decoration). Because you're making quite a big pie you'll want some structural support. If you don't have a pie funnel you can always use an upside down egg cup. Pop your filling in. And sprinkle with your extra strong cheddar. Roll out your lid and place on top. Seal it to the bottom with a little water along the edge and cut off the excess. Use the bits left over to make your decoration, I was lazy and made leaves but you can be as inventive as you like! Make a little hole in the very centre (into your funnel/egg cup). Pinch the edges. Brush with your beaten egg. And it's ready for its sauna! Pop it in the oven for 40-50mins, checking that it doesn't burn. When it's ready it should be golden brown with beautifully crackly, butter pastry. Serve with peas and cold pints of Guinness. One pie should feed 4-6 people depending on how hungry you are, but if you served it with with a big bowl of buttery mash and a little extra gravy you could easily feed 8. I think you are awesome. So awesome I wanted to ask your advice on something...I go to secondary school and there are these two boys I like. One of them is sporty, tall and fairly popular.

LACONIA, New Hampshire: You insert a token. With a joystick and a button you blast away at robots, spaceships and meteors advancing from all sides. Eventually your last man dies. Game over. Expletives are uttered. The next player has seen all your moves. For good measure Pat Benatar taunts, \"Hit me with your best shot.\" Spend a few hours here inside the American Classic Arcade Museum, perhaps the world's largest public collection of classic arcade games, and you'll lose track of not only the time of day but also the era. Red lights overhead create a perpetual Martian dusk. Eighties pop hits leak from hidden speakers as if they were some nostalgia-inducing gas. And though all of the more than 300 games are from 1988 or earlier, this is no collection of relics behind glass. Over the weekend, as leaders of the modern video game world gathered in Los Angeles for Wednesday's opening of the Electronic Entertainment Expo, a group of die-hard players converged here for the 14th Annual International Classic Video Game Tournament to celebrate a time when successful gaming meant entering initials on a high-score screen. While the expo, known as E3, is about the industry's future, the tournament, which attracted some 130 contestants, is a flashback to the days of Toto, leg warmers and \"Pac-Man Fever\". \"As far as I'm concerned, if you're into classic games, this is as big as it gets,\" said Robert Macaulay, 40, who journeyed here from Adelaide for his third year of competition. \"We don't even have arcades like this at home.\" Or anywhere. The games that once invaded malls and bars in 1970s and '80s have evaporated into pixel dust. Computers, home consoles and the internet largely killed arcades, once a booming business. Younger gamers who have never set foot inside of a classic arcade may not appreciate the role these hulking machines played in the history of digital entertainment. \"Gaming was public,\" said Raiford Guins, an associate professor of digital cultural studies at Stony Brook University. Aside from a digital calculator or watch, Guins said, the first encounter many had with a computer program was with an arcade game. \"They are part of computer history,\" he said, \"the history of play and the public experience.\" While the Wii and online gaming have reclaimed some of gaming's social dimension, arcade games were always a public performance. Players had distinctive postures, often throwing their bodies into the act of punching buttons and yanking on joysticks. The rivalrous gesture of placing a coin on the machine to declare, \"I got next\" -- a hangover from the pinball era -- has all but disappeared. By putting on tournaments and other fundraisers, the museum wants to revive that experience. \"Once the games played out, people just junked them. No one thought to preserve them,\" said Gary Vincent, the president and founder of the museum and a 31-year employee of Funspot, the arcade complex housing his exhibits. \"We are trying to save the history of competitive game play.\" That heritage is in jeopardy. In an era before hard drives these games ran on memory chips that are now three or four decades old. Spare parts are rare, and most technicians specialising in such repair have retired. \"The greatest pleasureI get is finding an old relic of a game in an old barn and bringing it back to life and letting people play it,\" Vincent said. He found one of the two dozen machines selected for this year's tournament, Buggy Challenge, in a Connecticut warehouse. \"It had mouse nests in it.\" The American Classic Arcade Museum might disappoint those seeking a comprehensive history of video arcades. But what the museum lacks in documentation it makes up for in its holdings. The pioneering games are all here, including \"Computer Space\" (1971), perhaps the first coin-operated video game; \"Pong\" (1972); and \"Space Invaders\" (1978). Visitors will find familiar names like \"Asteroids\" and \"Centipede\" as well as rows of obscure titles like \"Gun Fight\", \"Bosconian\", \"Qix\", \"Dragon's Lair\" and \"Tapper\". Another 150 games in storage could be added to the collection, though space and money for an expansion are scarce. Nostalgia is a driving force in celebrating old arcade games. The museum was made famous in the 2007 documentary \"The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters,\" about two \"Donkey Kong\" rivals, which helped jump-start a new appreciation of these classic games. Elsewhere the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, NY, has been amassing a collection of some 38,000 new and old video games and related artifacts. And the Smithsonian American Art Museum has mounted an exhibition called \"The Art of Video Games,\" on display until September 30. Recapturing youth draws competitors to the New Hampshire museum's tournament. \"It's definitely a way of rel"}

For most of the people who go to bed late it is mostly a problem of mentality. You look at the clock and think \"2:00 AM?\". Oh, no problem, I've still got plenty of time\". No, you don't. When you make it a habit to go to bed way past midnight, your idea of late becomes an increasingly later hour. So, the next time you look at the clock and see it's past 11:30 PM (or any time you'd consider 'early'), abandon everything you were doing at that time and start hurrying to go to bed. The first step in starting to go to bed early is redefining your idea of 'early' and 'late'. 2 Give yourself reasons for getting to bed earlier . One good incentive is recalling a time (or several) when your lateness in getting to bed had disastrous results: you overslept, didn't get enough sleep, became sick, etc. Also, if you're a habitual late-nighter (e.g. college student), this will give you a chance to see that rarest of natural phenomena: a sunrise! Staying up through the night to see the sunrise does not count! 3 Determine what time you need to wake up . \"Well, most of the time I wake-up at 7:00 AM, but sometimes I wake-up at 6:00 AM to do homework\" isn't a good answer. If you planned on waking up at 6:00 then you would think that going to bed an hour earlier would make up for it, but you wouldn't be tired at said bedtime, so you would lie in bed for an hour and only get 7 hours of sleep. Your wake-up time needs to be the same every day except for rare occasions. Weekends are not rare. 4 Subtract 8 hours from the time you wake up . Determine how long it actually takes you to fall asleep. Don't glance at the alarm clock constantly to test this, just think whether you lie in bed for what seems for hours, or does your head barely hit the pillow? If the first one is the case you should subtract one hour from the time you have. If your head barely hits the pillow you only need about five minutes in bed before your -8 hour time. If you're somewhere in between 30 minutes should be a safe amount of time to be in bed before you need to fall asleep. 5 Do something calming before bedtime . The computer may be calming but your brain naturally makes you sleepy when it is dark, so by staring at a screen you are keeping yourself alert and wide-awake for longer than you should. A shower is an excellent thing to do before bed. Make your activity a sort of habit. This helps. 6 Go to bed right when you start feeling tired . The best time to go to bed is when you can't stop yawning and feel the need to just close your eyes and lay your head down. If you force yourself to stay awake, after this stage is over, you'll have a slight headache because of tiredness, but stop feeling that urge to go to sleep, which makes you stay awake even more. 7 Be strict about your bedtime . Force yourself to turn off the computer and TV before bed. By turning off the computer (not the monitor) you would have to wait for it to reboot and normally that is enough to persuade you to get off the computer. Throw the remote for your TV across the room or onto the floor (gently). Getting up to turn on the TV hardly seems worth it, huh? 8 After you have been following a bed time for a week or so, if you are still tired or very unwilling to get up in the morning you may still owe yourself a few hours . Let yourself sleep way in on the weekend. Do this a few times and you will probably no longer feel the need to sleep in on the weekends. That's good. That means that you get enough sleep every night. If you keep wanting to get up earlier than your wake-up time then go to bed a little later. Some people need less sleep than others and you may no longer have to go to bed an hour early anymore because of your routine. 9 Reward yourself for your discipline . Treat yourself to a movie for every two weeks you successfully get to bed early. Notice how much better you feel in your day-to-day life, in school, or at your job. If you're getting somewhere around 8 hours of sleep per night, and at the right time, you'll probably notice a dramatic increase in your physical and mental health! Ensure that you are setting reasonable goals; some people cannot get 8 hours of sleep. Get a friend to see to it that you go to bed on time. They can hide the remote to the TV, or turn off the computer, or turn off the light where you are reading. They can also do this for themselves to prevent keeping you awake. Don't do this if you are irritable. Make sure you don't use the snooze button. Force yourself to literally jump out of bed every morning, even do a few jumping jacks to get the blood flowing. If you don't go to bed on time and get enough sleep you may suffer from poor sleep quality. Children may require extra sleep. Teens who have a big test the next day will do better if they go to bed early instead of staying up late to study. Feeling constantly tired or regularly waking up early can both be symptoms of depression. If you are worried that this may be the case for you, "}

For chemical distributors, transportation comprises a major part of their greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, and it is also the most challenging to assess due to the variety of transportation modes and the multitude of carriers. For example, one routine shipment of one product may include two countries, two trucks, a ship and a rail transport. The same product from the same supplier may be shipped differently the next time. With hundreds of products and thousands of shipments, keeping track of transportation emissions is a daunting task. Luckily, there is some help on the way: Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) is about to launch the pilot project SmartWay, a program they describe as \"an innovative partnership between public and private stakeholders with the shared goal of saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gases and air pollution from the freight transportation supply chain.\" SmartWay was originally developed and launched in 2004 by the Environmental Protection Agency in the US and has already proven to be a useful tool in calculating and reducing corporate GHG emissions. Participation in the program as an Affiliate Partner would allow distributors to compare carriers based on their environmental performance, track and improve the emissions impact of their goods movement, as well as demonstrate their environmental stewardship to the stakeholders. NRCan will work with carriers, suppliers and distributors to help them reduce their carbon footprint by shipping more efficiently and utilizing innovative technologies. There is no cost to enrollment; the only requirement is encouraging freight partners to participate in the program, which is actually very beneficial to the distributors as well. Carriers who are enrolled in SmartWay are required to calculate their fuel consumption and carbon footprint and submit an annual report to NRCan. This makes it much easier for the distributors to calculate their emissions; all they would have to do is estimate how many times they have used the services of registered carriers. If, however, an unregistered carrier is used, then the distributor would need to supply a lot more data to NRCan. This would lead to additional work on the part of the distributor since they would need to obtain their own emission information from non-enrolled carriers, and would also result in a less precise GHG calculation. It is therefore in everyone's interest to make sure that all (or most) carriers are enrolled in SmartWay. A carrier or a transport broker may ignore one customer's request to join SmartWay, but if all CACD member companies generate demand for SmartWay participation simultaneously, the carrier companies would be more likely to respond. This is a chance for chemical distribution companies to take advantage of, and promote, a helpful government initiative, while at the same time effecting a positive social change. Serguei Tchertok of Quadra is advocating on behalf of this program and I applaud his forward-thinking on this initiative.  Serguei says \"one company won't make a big difference, but if all the chemical distributors started this Program in their Company, CACD's members could make a big difference.\"  What a great way to improve your Company, Industry, Country and the Planet!!

Engage clinicians. Improve care. You are reading In a recent post I worried that the big wigs at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) would be underwhelmed by my contention that one of the main -- and perhaps the most important -- functional requirements to get more information used in clinical practice is trust in the information. I was worried the polysyllabic crowd at the Roundtable would want to hear brilliantly complex descriptions of technical requirements, taxonomies and interoperability standards. Thankfully they were brave enough to see the world for how it is. \"How it is\" is best exemplified by the oft-repeated fact that it takes, on average, 17 years for established clinical knowledge to become a routine part of clinical practice. Seventeen years. That's a long time. Sometimes being able to reduce complex medical knowledge to the size of a tweet can make it all the more powerful, but I find the opposite to be true with the \"seventeen years\". It's not a new fact and yet few healthcare leaders seem willing to get underneath it, understand why it's happening, and, quite frankly, be ashamed that what they do, week-in week-out, to people that they sell their trust to is probably hopelessly out of date. Over the next few weeks, I hope to share some of the fascinating presentations from the Roundtable, but I thought I would pull together some of the big themes in this post. This is a self-selected list, infused with personal biases, based on what I can remember from the day without looking at my notes -- I find this approach a powerful test of what really mattered or resonated with me. Although there was a strong focus on IT systems, the group were smart enough to realise that IT is just a tool to meet a clinical need. However, one view that floored me was from Steven E Waldren who contended that electronic health systems (EHRs) have been designed for \"business automation\" rather than clinical or efficiency ends. He used this contention as the basis for why most EHRs have awful user interfaces for clinicians. His view is that healthcare as a profession needs to define what standards it wants EHR providers to meet and then let them compete and innovate. He has put his money where his mouth is (always a good sign) and has created some standards that he offered to make open source so that others can contribute. This idea of an openly accessible central source was also applied to clinical knowledge. There was significant desire in the room to have a more consolidated body of knowledge rather than the current situation of numerous guidance procures, many producing conflicting guidance. A centrally maintained suite of knowledge could also be encoded in a manner that complies with the standards described above so that any EHR provider could use it. I found this dual vision of clinically-focussed EHR standards and consolidated knowledge compelling, and it made me wonder if England's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has it up its sleeve. I'd be mighty impressed if they did, but it seems unlikely for two reasons. First, NICE have shown little, if any, understanding of how to make their information useable, as evidenced by the publishing of humongous PDFs that are almost impossible to wade through. And secondly, the near-criminal handling of taxpayers' money in the National Programme for IT has undoubtedly killed any appetite for centrally mandated IT standards for years to come as evidenced by the recent information strategy that advocates more localism. The tension between national standards and locally-endorsed information reared its awkward head repeatedly, partly due to my insistence that doctors are more likely to follow the latter over the former (I discussed this in my recent post about trust ). My sense was that the room was divided, and, although I started the day being a passionate believer in the need for local endorsement, by the end I had tempered my view. This was partly due to the eloquence of James Walker , the Chief Medical Information Officer of Geisinger Health System who argued that in light of unjustified variations in care, doctors are simply going to have to accept that some clinical practices can be standardised country-wide to the point at which they will need to explain why they're varying ( Betsy Humphreys , the Deputy Director of the National Library of Medicine nodded sagely as he said this). This is less likely to happen for socially-complex, co-morbid patients but there really is no reason why it can't happen for more straight-forward patients with a single condition. It made me realise that national and locally-endorsed content need to play side-by-side, depending on the circumstance. One of the problems with enabling local doctors to amend content is who then has responsibility for what it says, including keeping it up-to-date. I believe this to be one of the most under-appreciated issues in the NHS and I was pleased that Blackford Middlet"}

I am well aware that he is in a 'position of trust and authority' -- and it may surprise British readers who have been given the impression by the British media that 'the French couldn't care less, because the age of consent is 15 in France' -- aye, it is, excluding sexual intercourse with 'apparent' consent obtained by abusing a postion of authority.  So let's nail that one on the head. Let's hope that there is more to this story than meets the eye; let's hope that the Sussex police were in possession of unrevealed information giving rise to a belief that she might have been in danger of some extreme physical harm -- for if not, I'll wager there will be many exceptionally angry parents in the UK today. We can start with those parents in Rochdale, who were told that their 10, 11, and 12 year old daughters were 'exercising their choice' in having sexual intercourse with men twice their age. Then move onto those parents who have discovered to their horror that Social Services were actually financially supporting their under age daughters in separate accommodation, the better to continue their relationship with petty thieves, car thieves, joy riders, drug addicts and all the other wholly unsuitable young men that girls can set their eye upon.  We can include all those parents who have reported their daughters missing, only to find that they are not 'officially' missing until several days after they have last been seen on account of 'they might just be staying with a friend'. There is no evidence published so far that Megan and Jeremy's relationship had changed from the unwise one which was already being investigated by the local authority, albeit slowly. Perhaps, just perhaps, they were genuinely fond of each other, which is not as yet a crime. Perhaps once the investigation commenced, they lived in fear that being fond of each other would lead to phrases like 'grooming', 'paedophile', not to mention my particular favourite -- 'lured away to Europe', a 'luring' which was achieved by producing her passport showing that she was already a citizen of that same Europe... You could sense the desperation of the Police as they tried to think of something that would allow them to issue a European arrest warrant; no evidence of sexual activity, no evidence that she had been taken against her will -- indeed it was she who (and before you jump up and down, I am well aware that she was legally vulnerable and impressionable) suggested that running away to France was a sensible option; of course he should have refused, but perhaps fearing the institutional panic that was about to envelope them, he unwisely didn't.  Finally the Police settled on removing her parent's property 'without their permission'. I am not railing against the age of consent, nor advocating that teachers be allowed to pillage young pupils virginity with impunity; I do wonder quite what it was about Megan Stammers or Jeremy Forrest that escalated a situation which happens in homes up and down the country without comment into an 'international man hunt' with child protection officers being flown hither and thither, counselling for fellow pupils and the full paraphernalia of paedophile hysteria? Because I am sure there are a lot of parents out there who fear their daughters are in far more danger than running off with the maths teacher, who would dearly love to know. If any such parent is reading this, contact me. I will happily campaign for you to receive precisely the same attention to mass publicity, especially if your daughter happens not to be white, middle class, and photogenic. If something emerges in the next few days showing that Jeremy Forrest posed a particular danger, above and beyond the legion of unwise choices made by young girls whose parents only want to have them back home unsullied, then I shall gladly eat my own Raccoon tail.

Thursday morning, 10 AM. I've decided my bad ankle means no dancing for me tonight. But I want to go out. I look at Google Calendars and see my friend Tim Watson is off to see Scenes from an Execution at the National Theater . It's described as \"funny\" and stars Fiona Shaw. I see there are some front row tickets available for twelve quid. I buy them. Job done. When I arrive at the National, I discover the show is running late, and that the \"first preview\" is now being billed as a \"final dress.\" We are offered the opportunity both to watch the show AND get our money back (as they say the show may be stopped in the middle) and I take it. With a running time of 2:45, an 8 PM start time now means that my jolly trip to the theater is about to become a Friday morning death march at work, and I want to be able to leave at the interval with a clear conscience. Getting home at midnight is just NOT the way to be a responsible arts lover and worker bee. Of course, I know that if I love it, I'll stay. It starts. A man is flying overhead in a box; Fiona Shaw is sitting on the floor in the most horrid rag while a naked man is draped across a rock. The man in the box tells us she is Galactia, female artist of the Renaissance; the man on the rock is her model and lover. She is preparing to paint the battle of Lepanto on commission for the Doge of Venice. Shaw approaches the man on the rock and starts a lusty scene. Her breasts are falling out of her top; I realize, with horror, that in my seat I am perfectly positioned to discover if she's actually completely without undergarments. I do NOT want to know. Somehow, Entertaining Mr Sloane turned the exact same situation into high comedy; but as scene after scene goes by with the same dress and my eyes at crotch level, I find myself just incredibly uncomfortable and looking at all sorts of different places on the stage. A man comes on stage with an arrow sticking out of his head. He can make it twitch. Galactia gets him upset, does some quick sketches, and brusquely sends him off stage. This marks the end of the comedic section of this play. Now as the play goes on, I start having troubles with the script. I think back on my knowledge of art history. There is no Galactia. The problems she's facing as a woman painting in Renaissance Italy are purely imaginary. She's not famous for her realism; no one has ever spoken of the Venetian artist Galactia because there has never been such a person. There are no daughter painters worrying about her legacy to them as a gender; there is no female art critic giving lectures on politics. There is no one worrying about a female artist's outrageous behavior at a funeral or her flaunting of social conventions. It's all made up. They are debating things that are irrelevant in the historical context. The women of this time were not allowed to do any of these things. We might as well be watching an episode of Mork and Mindy . I imagine its star is Space Commander Galactica and her glitterboots of wonder, single-handedly saving Venice for democracy and freeing all women to do and say what they want for all time. Only in my version, things are actually funny. Fiona Shaw and Robyn Williams would probably make an outstanding theatrical pair. When the interval rolls around, I don't care about Galactia and her imaginary daughters and the painting she never painted because she didn't exist. Her struggle to be personally true and free of the limits of politics in her work have no resonance. I leave, and I realize that, even though I can rebook, and would be happy to do so for full price for a good play, I don't consider this worthwhile, because despite some tremendous acting all around, the script is a dud and doesn't merit nearly a three hour commitment. I recognize that this was sold to me as a dress rehearsal rather than even a preview, and I give my feedback to you with these caveats. The problems I saw were due to the script, at such an essential level that I do not believe they can be overcome. Other people may feel differently; reviews of the entire show will be coming out soon. I will read them carefully to see if this show was able to salvage itself in the second act; I fear it is an impossible task. (This review is for a semi-preview, as described, given on Thursday, September 27th.)"}

The Daily Telegraph declares that 'flu vaccine effectiveness [is] exaggerated,' while the Daily Mail claims that 'flu jabs are a 'waste' of taxpayer's money.' Both headlines are exaggerations based loosely on a new report from researchers at the University of Minnesota. While the news stories go on to offer measured coverage of the report, the suggestion that the vaccine is of limited effectiveness in older people and a 'waste of money' is spurious and misleading when read out of context in the headlines. The report by a team of researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota covers multiple aspects of the flu vaccine in the US. It includes evidence of the vaccine's effectiveness, research and development efforts, vaccine production, and policy surrounding who gets the vaccine. While the flu vaccine is not 100% effective, the flu vaccination programme in the UK has proven effective at preventing deaths. Claims that the flu vaccine is in some way over-hyped are based on the report's finding that the perceived level of effectiveness may be putting vaccine manufacturers off investing in research into new types of flu vaccine. Multiple strains of the flu virus may be circulating in any given year. Current efforts to prepare for and combat flu epidemics include the widespread production and use of a yearly flu vaccine. This vaccine is developed to protect against three strains of the virus that experts predict will circulate during the upcoming winter flu season. How effective is the flu vaccine? The UK Department of Health (DH) reports that the current trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (the seasonal flu jab) has an overall efficacy, or success rate, of 59% among adults aged 18 to 65 years. Protection may be lower in the elderly. The type of flu vaccine recommended for children (a 'live' vaccine as opposed to an inactivated vaccine) is thought to be more effective, with a reported efficacy of 83% for children. The DH figures correspond with those reported in the current CIDRAP report. Who produced the report? The report was produced by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP). CIDRAP is a research unit based at the University of Minnesota in the US, which says it aims to \"prevent illness and death from infectious diseases through epidemiological research\". CIDRAP carried out an extensive review of flu vaccine efforts. The report authors reviewed studies published between 1967 and 2012 that looked into the effectiveness of flu vaccination. This report covers: the scientific basis of the vaccine, including research and development, and the safety and effectiveness of the annual vaccine the implementation of annual vaccination programmes, including the financing, manufacturing and distribution of the flu jab olicy and communication regarding the annual flu jab, including details on public education programmes, acceptance of the jab among patients, and public policy surrounding the vaccine What were the main findings of the report? The CIDRAP review reports 10 key findings, only some of which feature in current media coverage. The report says that the current flu vaccine offers \"substantially lower\" protection than that offered by most routinely recommended vaccines. However, the report has concluded that during some flu seasons, the jab offers substantially more protection for most people compared with not being vaccinated at all. It says that for one form of the vaccine (trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, or TIV) the evidence surrounding protection varied: among children aged of 2-17, they found inconsistent evidence of vaccine protection there was limited evidence of TIV effectiveness for people over the age of 65 For the other type of vaccine (live attenuated influenza vaccine, or LAIV), CIDRAP found: evidence of high protection (approximately 83%) among children aged six months to seven years a lack of evidence for protection among people aged 8-59 limited evidence among adults over the age of 60 The review found that commonly cited figures regarding flu vaccine effectiveness are largely based on studies with poor methodology, and studies employing better methods have not reported protection levels as high. The authors suggest that this perception of vaccine effectiveness prevents research into the development of highly effective vaccines. Over the last 50 years in the US the groups of people recommended to receive the annual flu jab have expanded beyond those at high risk of complication. The study authors report that these recommendations were often based on professional judgement and not scientific evidence. New approaches to flu vaccine development may offer increased protection against seasonal flu, but more research support is needed to determine whether these approaches could result in \"game-changing vaccines\""}

And the 22-year-old bird enthusiast, who just set a new record for the most species spotted in one year in Ontario, is likely glued to his cell phone as he vanishes into the forest, tracking the most up-to-the-minute messages from other birders sharing the latest sightings. Vandermeulen is nearing the end of a \"Big Year\" -- birding terminology for a self-imposed Jan. 1 to Dec. 31 challenge to spot and record as many species as possible in a given area. For Vandermeulen, that area covers all of Ontario, and technology has been essential to helping him achieve his goal of breaking the longstanding record of 338 sightings, set back in 1996. In order to achieve that goal, he had to record a sighting of every single bird seen annually in Ontario, as well as about 20 rare species -- a hit-and-miss endeavour dependent on weather, timing, and luck. He's currently sitting at 342 -- it was the sighting of a Northern Fulmar on Oct. 29 that broke the previous record of 338 -- and hopes to top out around 345 by year's end. \"There's a stigma about a birder as an old person in a Tilly hat, when really that's not the case,\" he told CTVNews.ca from his home in Guelph, Ont. \"A lot of us are young people who are into it because we're interested in nature, in being outside. \"There are a lot of young people who are using technology, and for me in my Big Years it's been really helpful. I can be out in the field somewhere and I get a text, or I check my email on my phone and I hear about a sighting, and I can race off and see that bird.\" Between Facebook, email, text messages, his blog and the massive North American eBird database -- a citizen science initiative that thousands of birders use to record their sightings -- Vandermeulen is about as plugged in as you can get in the birding world. Although, he admits there's irony in the fact he isn't yet on Twitter. But it takes more than technology to set a record such as the one Vandermeulen currently holds. Mostly, it takes commitment. The recent graduate from Guelph University essentially dedicated his entire year to the project -- living off his savings, working \"as little as possible\" and using the year as an opportunity to pursue his passion, travel to far flung corners of the province, meet similar-minded people and having a great adventure along the way before entering the work world in 2013. It helped that his family and friends were supportive -- and, he admits sheepishly, that his girlfriend is currently studying abroad -- freeing him up to focus most of his time, money and energy on his other love: birds. \"I thought, I don't want to go into the workforce right away, why not do a big year? I'm a birder, I like travelling, I like meeting interesting people and this is just a great excuse to do that,\" he said. Vandermeulen has had a lot of adventures along the way. His car broke down on a lonely road between Cochrane, Ont. and Thunder Bay, a helicopter was delayed for three days at the end of a three-week sojourn to James Bay -- fortunately allowing Vandermeulen to spot two more species he hadn't expected to see -- and he ended up under the same tree, searching for the same bird as the previous Big Year record-holder he was trying to surpass, Glen Coady. But it takes more than just commitment to break a record that has stood for more than 15 years. It also takes luck, and Vandermeulen is the first to admit that he had plenty. Coady set his record in what birders would consider a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Hurricane Fran had blasted through the province in 1996, bringing with it many non-native bird species that simply don't come to Ontario unless by misadventure in a storm. As a result, he said, \"a lot of people thought the number 338 was impossible to beat.\" But Vandermeulen timed his year well too -- something he admits came entirely down to chance. The mild 2011/2012 winter meant that rare birds that sometimes show up briefly in the fall, then depart, actually stayed until January, giving him the opportunity to start his year with some unexpected and unusual sightings. Then in the spring, powerful weather systems blowing up from the south brought a number of tropical migratory birds further north than they normally would travel, including a Western Tananger and Bell's Vireo -- birds that are seldom seen in Ontario. And in the early summer, a tropical storm in the Atlantic delivered a gift to Vandermeulen more valuable than anything money could buy -- a sighting of a Magnificent Frigatebird \"That was quite the surprise because they're a tropical species, you see them in southern Florida, they're these massive black birds with angular wings that look kind of sinister when they're flying. But to get one in Ontario was incredible, I think that was the seven"}

I'd get rid of the stuff about not being able to afford to pay the 'fine'. It isn't a 'fine' anyway and whether or not a given person can afford to pay it or not is irrelevant. If I were to go to the Savoy and order the lobster would they let me off the bill if I claimed to be a bit skint? You also say \"I will be left with no choice but to take further action in the small claims court as I believe the charges I have paid are unfair\". Lots of things in life are unfair but just to say that you think a charge levied against you is unfair isn't, of itself, demonstrating that you have a 'cause of action'. You could, in a given case, first work in references to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations - but the whole basis of lawful clamping [if indeed it can still be lawful at all these days] is not that it is done pursuant to a contract that the driver enters into, it is merely that he has consented to the risk of being clamped and having to pay a release fee. You could work in a reference to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2009 which, as the title suggests prohibit unfair commercial practices but the 2009 Regs are concerned with the criminal law, rather than civil law. Personally, I would just remove the \"as I believe the charges I have paid are unfair\" from the sentence so that it just says \"If you do not refund the money I will be left with no choice but to take further action in the small claims court\" NBAs don't have to be long. Their purpose is (1) to say 'pay up or be sued' (although, of course, something of the legal basis as to why they ought to pay should be included) , and (2) to satisfy the court that you have not rushed into legal proceedings without giving the defendants a chance to settle voluntarily. It is interesting that Ms Hahn of Active4less/Flex Gym claims that the clamping operation is nothing to do with them. On this thread here http://forums.pepipoo.com/lofiversion/in\\\\... the OP (Shal) said that when Global refunded him his 275 they requested that he write to the gym to confirm that he'd been given his money back.

If you or others have any better way to approach this then I would be happy for the info. southpaw82 Sat, 18 Feb 2012 - 16:38 Clamping is prima facie a trespass to goods. Clamping only becomes lawful if the clamper can then show that he has a defence to that trespass. The usual defence is one of consent, i.e. the driver saw the signs and implicitly accepted the risk of being clamped. Only if the clamper can prove (on the balance of probabilities) that consent was given - through prominent and obvious signs being present - does the claimant then need to go about disproving that consent was present by, for example, showing that signs weren't present, or weren't visible or whatever the particular circumstances may be. Contract law doesn't really enter into it, except arguably over the release fee. Do not become mistaken between the usual claim made by a PPC that has issued a \"parking charge notice\" and clamping. The former is usually grounded in a [spurious] contract. The latter relies on the tort of trespass. all321 Wed, 10 Oct 2012 - 16:20 Just wanted to update the forum with some good news.

Photograph by: Archive , Calgary Herald Canada's obesity crisis is giving birth to a new problem: an increasing number of caesarean sections among obese mothers-to-be. A study of nearly 12,000 women who delivered over a 10-year-period at Montreal's Royal Victoria Hospital found that doctors are far quicker to call for a C-section on women with higher body mass indexes, or BMIs . It's not clear why, but researchers say many doctors are scared to deal with obese women. Labour can be slower and many physicians fear that a heavier woman necessarily means a bigger baby that could get stuck in the birth canal. They're also more hesitant to use forceps on an obese mother to pull the baby out. Appearing in the current issue of the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology Canada, the study is the latest in a recent flurry of papers on the sobering risks of obesity in pregnancy ?? which include a higher risk of death to mothers and a near doubling in the odds of a baby dying in the womb or within the first year of life. The organization representing Canada's pregnancy specialists has called for a national strategy to challenge laissez-faire attitudes about pre-pregnancy weight and to educate women about the risks to their babies, as well as to their own bodies. Meanwhile, the growing proportion of obese expectant mothers is putting pressure on maternity wards. In Ottawa, The Ottawa Hospital has upgraded operating tables and purchased special retractors to hold back the pannis ?? the apron of fat that hangs over the lower part of the abdomen. \"Everybody is uncomfortable when you're dealing with a very big woman,\" says Dr. Lawrence Oppenheimer, site lead for obstetrics at the General Campus of the Ottawa Hospital. \"You're sort of damned if you do and damned if you don't. The caesarean is going to be difficult, and so is the vaginal birth.\" Oppenheimer was recently called to assist in a delivery involving a 400-pound woman. The baby's head was \"virtually on view, but not coming out.\" He and another senior colleague performed a forceps delivery, and the baby came out fine. \"Clearly in that situation it just didn't make sense for a 400-pound woman to have a caesarean when the head was so low,\" Oppenheimer said. But, \"it's just an example of how we're becoming super cautious.\" The number of obese expectant moms, he says, \"is an epidemic. We're just seeing way more bigger women than we used to.\" According to Statistics Canada, 29 per cent of women in Canada are overweight, and 23 per cent are obese. Obesity rates have been climbing fastest for women aged 25 to 34 ?? the group that delivers more than 60 per cent of babies born in Canada each year ?? nearly doubling in the past 25 years. Not only are obese women up to 2.5 times more likely than healthy-weight women to undergo a C-section, but also every risk of pregnancy is amplified by obesity. According to back-to-back studies published in the past month alone: - In addition to an increased risk of pregnancy-threatening high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and pre-term birth, obese women are less able to fight infections such as chorioamnionitis ?? a potentially serious condition that can lead to blood clots in the mother's pelvis and lungs, and to meningitis, blood infection or respiratory problems in their newborns; - Babies of obese moms are at higher risk for iron deficiency, which can impair brain development; - Obesity increases the risk of fetal and infant death. Researchers from Newcastle University in the United Kingdom who studied more than 40,000 pregnancies estimated that there were nearly eight more fetal or infant deaths per 1,000 births among obese women than among women with healthy BMIs. Obese women have a two- to three-times greater risk of delivering a baby with a neural tube defect ?? defects of the brain and spinal cord ?? than women of normal weight, and the heavier the woman, the worse the risk, according to the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. A mother's obesity also increases the risk of other major congenital malformations such heart defects, abnormalities of the rectum and hydrocephalus ?? swelling in the brain. Ultrasounds can pick up problems early in pregnancy, but obesity makes it significantly harder to view the fetal heart, spine, kidney and other organs because the sound waves have to penetrate through more fat tissue. In addition, using ultrasound to estimate fetal weight is an inaccurate science at the best of times, Oppenheimer says. With obese women, it's even sketchier because it's harder to visualize the fetus. \"We're just way more cautious in these women than we would be with normal weight just because of the potential increased size of the baby,\" he says. Babies who are heavier tend to put extra fat on around their shou"}

The sample was composed of 48 games (n= 4548 field-goals gathered) corresponding to the 2009-2010 Top 16 of the Euroleague. The analyzed variables were the unsuccessful attempted field goals, which generate rebounds, and then sample was split into three groups: i) paint zone, ii) two points zone, and, iii) three points zone. To analyze the side of rebound, the court was divided: i) same side and ii) opposite side of the field goal attempt. The results of the present study showed: i) 46.5% of the shoots were taken from the paint compared with 38.3% taken from the 3 point zone and 15.2% taken from the 2 point zone; ii) near 91% of all rebounds were obtained inside the paint while there were no rebounds in three point zone; iii) when shoots were taken inside the paint, the same side had statistically significant more percentage of rebounds than the opposite side.

That would suggest that conservatives are being blamed, not incumbents.\" Let's do a very quick whiz round to see how things seem to be travelling in various comparable democracies. Germany : Merkel party slumps in poll as financial crisis hits Germany . \"The CDU and her sister party, the Christian Social Democrats (CSU), fell four points to 33 percent which is the lowest level since early 2007, according to a survey released jointly by the Hamburg-based Stern news magazine and the commercial RTL broadcasting network.\" New Zealand : New Zealand Election Tightens . \"In early October 2008 the New Zealand Roy Morgan Poll shows National Party support at 40.5% (down 7%), a tight lead over the Labour Party 37.5% (up 1%). If the Election were this weekend there would be a hung Parliament in New Zealand with either major party capable of forming a governing coalition.\" United Kingdom : Labour halves Tory lead in opinion poll : \"The opposition was ahead of the ruling party by a record 20-points last week. Today, a YouGov poll, commissioned by The Sun, showed the Labour party stood at 31 points -- a 10 point gain on the previous gap.\" Canada : Harper keeps sinking in polls . \"With Stephen Harper and his Conservatives losing popularity throughout most of the country, the poll-takers yesterday offered the party a gloomy diagnosis: They see few signs of improvement before voting day on Tuesday.\" Though admittedly ... Italy : Berlusconi honeymoon with the Italians . \"They call it 'honeymoon'. This is no romantic movie, though, it's the nickname that Italian newspapers gave to a new political phenomenon: Berlusconi's personal degree of favor among the Italians, his popularity has now reached 60%.\". Italy always was different, I guess. I'm calling it a win for hypothesis two. Austrian fascist leader. When his party went into a coalition government with the conservatives the EU placed sanctions against Austria. The fascists gained a significant swing and quite a few seats in the recent election. Adam you are very unwise to believe this i must admit! Haider split the far right vote how would you like it now that the FPO will almost certainly get all of the BZO (10%) vote and go into the high 20s!!!! That is not good the only good thing was the far right split its vote, now the FPO will become as dominant as the OVP not good news. How typical it's the conservatives to blame...it always has to be. What a JOKE! Glen, Haider was a loathsome N*zi t*rd and I don't care what the political consequences of his demise are, I am just pro-demise-of-N*zi-t*rds. On the serious matter, IF the Tories lose in Canada, AND Labour is re-elected in NZ, AND British Labour comes back in the polls, AND Obama has a monster win, AND Rudd gets a poll bounce, you will have to conclude that in the English-speaking world (ie, the direct sphere of US cultural-political influence), conservatives as a generic category are being blamed by the voters for the current world economic disaster. These things haven't yet, but there are signs that they are going to. I don't like Haider any more than you do Adam but his death is a boost to the FPO and that is dangerous another election result like the last one and far rightist will be a dominant force in Austrian politics. If i were Austrian id be voting OVP, i dont like the FPO or BZO. While the Tories will still prob win in both Canada and NZ, it won't be with the majority governments that were predicted for both parties in recent months. Almost certainly, both will need the help of centrist parties to win government. As for the UK tories, they're now in a tricky situation. If their lead narrows further, they almost certainly won't be able to form a majority government, as most of their core vote is located in Tory strongholds throughout the South-East. The small blessing for them is that it looks certain that Gordon Brown won't be deposed by the Labour party as their leader while this polling improvement continues...

Entitled \"Religion in the Future Global Civiization\", it assessed the likelihood of some movement towards unity or at least a significant reduction in antagonism among the world religions in this century. It was written by Thomas McFaul, a professor of ethics and religious studies at North Central College in Illinois . The Asian religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, among others) \"share common themes of enlightenment, karma, reincarnation, and duty.\" But their views of God differ -- Hinduism and Sikhism are pantheistic seeing the universe as the body of God; Buddhism and Jainism do not incorporate the notion of God in their worldviews. The Abrahamic religions from the Middle East are monotheistic, believe in progressive revelation of God's will and that life (one life) after death is determined by one's obedience to God's law. Each has a sacred text and a divine mediator who reveals the will of God (Moses, Jesus, Muhammad). But they share beliefs in human virtues such as compassion, honesty and justice. McFaul advances the notions that the Abrahamic faiths will grow closer together if: they come to accept that each of their religions is revealing truths about the same God and that together they give a more comprehensive understanding of God's purpose for humanity -- there are multiple pathways to God they also accept that God has been revealing Truth over time and in different places without favouring any one religion. While this might sound eminently reasonable digging deeper into the differences of scriptures, theology and liturgies brings out matters less easily resolved. But there is perhaps a basis for a start to dialogues (trialogue?). The author similarly addresses how the Eastern religions might grow closer together. McFaul suggests three scenarios, three visions of the future (say 2050). Scenario 1 - Exclusivism: I'm Right and You're Wrong The sort of increases in confrontation between different parts of the world based largely on religion have increased, and this has posed greater problems for humanity as previously powerless parts have developed the military, political and economic strength to underpin such confrontation. \"Hatred and hostility in the global village have increased.\" Scenario 2 -- Pluralism: Despite Our Differences, We Can Live Together As communication has increased within the global village misunderstandings and ignorance have abated very considerably. Humanity has better been able to live in harmony with one another becoming more aware of the commonalities and more accepting of the differences. Tolerance towards worldview differences has increased and common beliefs about preferred human behaviour drives collaboration. Scenario 3 -- Inclusivism: We're Becoming One Family Basing dialogue on the common beliefs in compassion, peace, justice, mercy, love and kindness, religious leaders and active laity throughout the world gradually worked towards a more inclusive worldview seeking out truths that all would find acceptable. It was not an easy task -- in fact it became a work in progress. Emphasis was given to how we live as global citizens united by the need to solve global problems; past traditions came to be less dominating eventually receding into the background. Having established these scenarios McFaul suggests: that Inclusivism, while the preferred scenario, is most unlikely Pluralism will rise but not until somewhere between 2025 and 2050 will the power of communication mechanisms build sufficient knowledge and understanding to underpin this scenario Exclusivism will prevail until then, and indeed it will increase. The author does however acknowledge that Exclusivism could continue well into the future. For what it's worth I believe that Exclusivism will reign supreme well into our futures until such time as an unprecedented crisis (climate induced, WMD induced, asteroid collision with the Earth) shows that we all do depend on one another and that for humanity to survive we need to put aside our differences. It might well be that secularists take a lead at that time. (The complete McFaul article is available for US$2 on the World Future Society site ( www.wfs.org ).

You kind of failed to help me out earlier when I was asking about \"how to set a global mail profile for database mail in Microsoft SQL 2005.\" Here's what I wish you had said: First of all, \"Database mail\" (\"DBMail\" or \"Sysmail\") is not the same as \"SQL mail\" (\"SQLMail\"). They're both stupid and overly complex, but DBMail is newer and slightly less stupid. SQLMail uses an installed MAPI provider on your system to send mail, which means you need such a thing, possibly Outlook. DBMail apparently ignores your MAPI provider entirely. So if you find an article that says you need to install Outlook first, just ignore it; it's not true. People keep posting articles like Why China Needs US Debt . I think most of us know enough to disregard random opinion pieces written by lobbyists, and most of us who read such an article will get a \"wait, that can't be right\" feeling. But what exactly is wrong? China obviously does need us, right? Or why would they trade with us? I first started to understand the problem while I was watching the Canadian federal election debates and someone (it might have been the Green Party leader) said something like, \"We have to cut back on our oil exports! It's killing Canada's manufacturing industry!\" ...and I did a double take. Wait. What? I had to look into it a bit before I understood. What was happening was that the increased oil prices were causing a flood of activity into Canada's Oil Sands projects, and thus a massive increase in oil exports. Increased exports were raising the value of the Canadian dollar (which, importantly, is not pegged to any other currency). A higher Canadian dollar makes it harder for people from other countries to buy Canadian stuff: not just oil, but anything. And unlike with oil, our other industries didn't have a massive natural (read: Canada's really big ) competitive advantage. Which means that if our oil exports expand massively, it kills our manufacturing sector. The success of one industry, unrelated except by trading in the same currency, (1) can harm another industry. And that realization, to me, was a new and important one. Now, back to China. Their currency, in light of being pegged to the US currency, is essentially the same as the US currency. What does that mean? Success in exports in one sector (China manufacturing) can damage the market in another sector (US manufacturing) even if they manufacture totally different things, simply because the successful market artificially raises the prices of the unsuccessful market. Now, pegging your currency can be kind of expensive. China does it by stockpiling truckloads of US dollars. Well, more precisely, they buy US debt, which is essentially the same thing. What this really means is that China takes much of the profit from its exports and mails them back to the US (as \"debt\"), so that the US can afford to buy more Chinese stuff. In the article I linked to above, the claim is that China needs US debt to keep increasing, because there's simply nothing else in the world big enough to spend all those US dollars on. And that's true, in a sense, if you believe that money has intrinsic value . Of course, China is smart enough to know that it doesn't. ...which is where it gets even stranger. Even though China knows money is worthless, they keep shipping their perfectly valuable manufactured goods to us in exchange for worthless pieces of paper . (2) How dumb is that ? Not dumb. Brilliant. Our whole theory of economics is based on two axioms, one of which is that human wants are unlimited . But we're starting to figure out that's not really true. As a society, we're slowly realizing that more consumption doesn't lead to more happiness. So what does? For a lot of people, maybe the secret to daily happiness is just this: a stable job and the feeling that you're doing it well and helping society. By exporting stuff to us by the crapload - and \"oh darn, poor us, we're such victims \" denominating their wealth in US dollars - they ensure that they have jobs and happiness. We're the helpless, unproductive, soulless consumers. Call it victory by superior philosophy. (3) Footnotes (1) Of course, our manufacturing industry also uses a lot of energy, and high energy prices are bad for them too. But that's true for everyone's manufacturing industry, so it's not automatically a competitive disadvantage. (2) Thought experiment: imagine China as a black box with inputs and outputs. From the point of view of China, sending us useful goods (which we'll use up and then dump in our landfills) is a lot like just taking those goods and dumping them in the ocean. As far as China is concerned, nothing would be very different if all the ships just sank before they arrived here. (3) It's a strange war, though: you don't have to worry about them invading us if they win. What would they steal? Our consumers?

With ballots counted and results called, it's unclear what influence Hurricane Sandy had on the outcome of the election. Ohio State political science professor Paul Beck said it's hard to tell what role the storm had in the outcome of the Nov. 6 election. \"I am not sure if I can answer that question well, or if anyone can,\" Beck said. Matt Hitt , a political science graduate student, said the outcome of a presidential election is influenced by many variables, making it hard to determine the role the storm played. \"It was the campaign, it was debate performance, it was his (President Barack Obama's) advertising, it was response to Hurricane Sandy, it was Osama bin Laden, it was the auto industry,\" Hitt said of Obama's re-election. \"It was probably all of those things.\" Hitt said the hurricane probably did influence voter turnout in the states significantly affected by the hurricane, such as New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. However, both he and Beck said this was no problem for Obama's campaign. \"One thing we can say for sure is Hurricane Sandy didn't hurt the president,\" Hitt said. Beck said natural disasters have an important part in the political arena because they give the candidate an opportunity to act presidential. He said that during the 2010 BP oil spill, people questioned Obama and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's ability to act accordingly during natural disasters. During this latest test of presidential qualities, Beck said Obama and FEMA performed very well. Beck said even if he had done poorly with addressing the disaster, it might not have mattered. \"At that point in the campaign most people have their minds made up,\" Beck said. Beck explained the states most heavily influenced by the storm were not battleground states. He said that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were claimed as blue before the hurricane made landfall, so the storm was unlikely to sway voters there. \"Obama's advantage was so big in those states that even the reduced turnout didn't matter,\" Hitt said. \"He still won them quite (handily).\" Josh Foster, a first-year in exercise science education, said he did not pay much attention to the campaign and attributed his decision to the negative television ads. Foster said he thought the ads are the biggest factor contributing to low voter turnout, and if the ads were more positive, he would have had more of an interest in the election. \"I wish they would educate more,\" Foster said. \"I wish media would be a little more descriptive, and positive.\" Hitt said students should remember the social nature of this world. He said things are rarely as simple as a single event influencing the outcome of an election. \"For us to be able to use the tools of social science to peel it apart and say this one thing caused it, independent of all those other things, is a very difficult thing for us to do,\" Hitt said. \"A lot of the times it is reasonable to say that is part of why it happened.\" Hurricane Sandy was downgraded to a superstorm upon landfall last month, but the storm devastated parts of New Jersey and New York, as well as other parts of the East Coast. Thousands on the coast were forced to evacuate their homes due to flooding. More than 110 people in the U.S. died and about 70 people died when the storm hit the Caribbean before arriving on the East Coast. Thousands remained without power Monday, almost two weeks after the storm hit the U.S. Recommended: Articles that may interest you Be the first to comment on this article!

This post is only 4 lines long and already I am sounding like scrooge. My new frugal self, the person who lives within her means (well tries to) and has no credit cards is taking a staged approach here. What is more, if you don't buy too much food too soon your family can't eat everything before Christmas Eve and what is more you have the chance of just one more pound off for the last pre-christmas weigh in (tomorrow). So here is my count down calendar: Wednesday  -- Slimming world Christmas party. The same two pounds has been gained and lost a few times recently. Which means that since my cruise at the end of October I have only lost 2.5lb. 2008 will be a new year though and actually 18lb since August isn't so bad. So after the weigh in I am going to enjoy myself with my slimming chums. Thursday -- Pay day. I still have a number of key people to buy for, including my 2 nephews, 2 neices and my parents. Nut actually I know what is to be bought and I intend to pick all of them up on Thursday evening after work. Friday -- Last working day before Christmas. I will be popping out of work at lunch time and buying my last few things. I will also be picking up some nice food and drink. I haven't yet wrapped even one present and my intention is a nice bottle of wine, some nice nibbles (ones not allowed at slimming world) and present wrapping, perhaps with carols! Saturday -- Hubby and I are planning a late afternoon trip up to London to see the lights. One of the great things at Christmas is to see the decorated shops and the lovely lights adorning all the major shopping streets. Sunday -- A day for chilling perhaps? Monday -- Christmas Eve and last minute shopping, maybe something to wear, maybe just a wander around especially if any of the shops move into early sale mode! Then it is off to my parents during the evening and Christmas will begin. This post is due to my lack of post ideas for today, lets hope I can do better tomorrow!"}

To articulate hypothesis of productive cross-cultural training bulletin for (IHRM) administrator. CONTRIBUTION OF EXISTING LITERATURES Human Resource Management (HRM) is apperceive and acquiring in the capacious faculty of the denomination, as a anatomy of administration that contains \" entire administration adjudications and agility that influence the attributes of the connection among the business and the staff -- its anthropological -contraption management\" (Beer, 1984). It is characterize as the method of accommodating an organization's human resources, or attendant, to fulfill business aims. As possibly examine predicate on the clarification, the employment of those attachments in HRM can be intricate as it comprise all issues that circumscribe employee and compact relationship. Consider that the most substantial asset of an employment is the person in order to accomplish endorse business achievement is the gist principles of (HRM). Understand this supremacy to a imperative management of human beings inside the business. Its principles are constructing on the clear assumption that HR are the abundant substantial benefits in actualizing and approving organization profitability. This achievement evolves into the animate power behind the conception of (HRM) developing in business acquiring a strategic way to the authority of their community. The Internationalization of HRM In this modern lifetime of international frugality, extensive interconnection of capability, retail and corporation antagonism arrive (Schermerhorn, 2001). The beginning of internationalization has brought up organizations and its controllers to anticipate and act universally to be capable to gain combative advantages. There are two controvert views: some aspect internationalization as an contingency for countless profitability and affluence for both establish and unestablish citizens; although others see it as a warning to further the magnitude of discrimination by way of growing competition and the ascendancy of market conscriptions seen in continental companies. (Johnson & Turner, 2003). The association of these contractions in global business is widespread because of the accentuation on relation which incites a consideration of the dissimilar cooperative compromise among multinational companies... just like domestic abuttal's have progressively been becloud, it has evolve into clamorous that multinational companies take benefit of assembling cooperative composition or collective approach those are conceive to be a constructive technique to avail progress. that movement has influence even organizations  precisely emulating with against each other like Hitt, Ireland and Hoskisson (2003) has bestow the model of FedEx and the US Postal Service. Consummate a seven-year affiliation which advantage both companies. Another extent of Business Corporation that is influence by the globalization of corporations is the field of (HRM). As a result corporation has emerged as globalized, the mechanism and aspects that fictionalize the human resources management approach have also become worldwide. Accordingly, outside of this specific field HRM, a new cropland has been cultivated -- that is (IHRM). The enclosure of HRM ascribe to the: \"... appreciating, examining, assigning and improve all HR activeness in their constitutional and extrinsic circumstances as they force the method of managing HRM in organizations all over the international atmosphere to increase the knowledge of diversified stakeholders,  including investors, consumers, employees,  colleague, suppliers, environment and  civilization (Briscoe and Schuler, 2004, p,20).

The study is titled, Do You Believe in Atheists? Distrust is Central to Anti-Atheist Prejudice. The researchers conducted a series of six studies with 350 American adults and nearly 420 university students in Canada, posing a number of hypothetical questions and scenarios to the groups. In one study, participants found a description of an untrustworthy person to be more representative of atheists than of Christians, Muslims, gay men, feminists or Jewish people.

Imagine an island the size of Manhattan being ripped from the continental crust, lifted into the air and turned upside down. Except that this is the Arctic, so the cinema screen is filled with the roiling, foaming whites, greys and blues of gritty snow and ice in turmoil. It's an awesome sight, one you're not likely to forget. The sequence is the crowning jewel of Chasing Ice , the new documentary film about the work of environmental photographer James Balog . Back in 2005 and 2006, The New Yorker and National Geographic sent Balog to the Arctic for two photo assignments on ice. Those projects, his first venture into the far north, inspired him to start the Extreme Ice Survey (EIS). Balog and his collaborators painstakingly staked dozens of time-lapse cameras to rock faces, aimed at moving glaciers in Greenland, Iceland, Alaska, Canada, the Himalayas and the US Rocky Mountains, and left them there to record history. (Image: 2008 James Balog/Extreme Ice Survey) Chasing Ice is just one part of the EIS, born of Balog's burning desire to show the world what the death throes of glaciers in our unparalleled environment look like. The film - I hope the first of several - is a sort of \"making of\" documentary which follows Balog and his small team of scientists-cum-adventurers as they head into the Arctic to set up the equipment. The freezing temperatures, gale-force winds, ruined knees (we see Balog tackle frozen climbs on crutches while his assistants shake their heads in despair), days of waiting, bitter disappointments when electronics are defeated by the elements, and, finally, the images. Strung together in time-lapse sequences, they bring the ice to life. And paired in \"now you see the glacier, now you don't\" comparisons, they also record its demise. Balog's story is just as integral to the film as that of the ice. He confesses that, in spite of his scientific training, once upon a time he was a climate sceptic . His desperate desire to commit the ice to digital celluloid before it is too late almost feels like penance. In one scene, he holds up a memory chip that he has just pulled out of one of his cameras, a year after leaving it to do its job. \"This is the memory of the camera,\" he says, and then something occurs to him. \"And this is the memory of the landscape. That landscape is gone, it may never be seen again in the history of civilisation and it's stored right here.\" The film delivers visual beauty in spades. Balog's images manage to distil something intangible about our relationship with nature, but the sounds that accompany them in Chasing Ice transport you more than any photography exhibition could. Ice groans as it expires, wind lashes at the technical fabrics that ensure the team's survival, torrents of water crash into bottomless cracks in the ice. To paraphrase Robert Redford's remarks about the film, it deserves to be not just seen but also felt on the big screen. I've been waiting for years for a feature-length film about climate change that would go beyond a lecture about science or a trite sci-fi attempt at narrative. Is this it? Nearly. It is so good to finally have someone show, not tell. I only wish the film-makers had not been tempted to include the graphs, science explanations, and the opening sequence in which excerpts from newscasts on natural disasters are stacked in rapid succession. We've seen those before and know they only preach to the converted. In between, though, Chasing Ice engulfs you in the magnificence of a world most of us will never see. Which only leaves the question, \"Why?\""}

Some years ago new neighbours moved into our street. There was a young high school student in the family - a lovely young girl, seemingly full of life. The parents were away, but there was an older family member living with her, so she was not totally alone and the young girl would frequently have her friends over. The friendly and happy laughter I heard as I walked past the home one afternoon gave the impression that all was well.  Then only weeks after, I heard that the young girl had committed suicide. I was totally shocked! As I extended my condolences to the older family member, her reaction was one of anger. \"How could she be so cruel, so selfish. She knew I would open the door and find her there, how could she do this to me?\" It was not the response I had expected. I expressed that it must have been horrific for her to discover, but I also told her that I was certain that it was not intentional. That for this lovely young girl to take her life she must have felt that there was no way out of the torment that she was experiencing.\" It's difficult to understand how a person can take his/her own life -- but I truly believe that at that minute, they cannot see another option. Research tells us that of those who attempt suicide and fail, most are happy that they were not successful, even if they are left with sustainable injuries. There are many things that contribute to the escalating number of youth, suicide and it's not always a psychological reason, sometimes it can be an undetected physiological one. Many years ago I experienced depression, but when I had some biochemical tests done, I was found to be deficient in something that my body needed but was not getting. When someone comes to me for counselling, I always suggest a total physical check-up before even beginning therapy. Once the physiological lack is addressed we can make a good start on all other levels. But in all sincerity, no amount of counselling can address or correct something that is physiologically determined. Depression needs to be addressed from all fronts if it is to be healed -- physiologically, psychologically, culturally and spiritually. Watching \"There is no 3G in Heaven,\" on Four Corners (ABC) last night, was what compelled me to talk about suicide here. From my work I can truly tell you that some people do have a difficult time being here. If we can help them through the toughest patch, then they have a better chance at experiencing the beauty of life that they cannot see when they are in that dark place. What do you think? Comments You are right. I too suffer depression. I was in that very dark place But I never considered suicide. I saw nothing in life to live for, to look forward to but I knew that wasn't an option primarily because I could not do that to my children. At that time I was suffering empty nest (which the textbook empty nest does not even approach the true Blackness of that. I didn't know what I was supposed to do with the second half of my life. I saw no purpose in my remaining years. But I am also hypothyroid, menapausal and was hormonally unstable. My regular doctor diagnosed the first two, I discovered the third myself from self study. Had I not discovered that my hormones were to blame I could have tried forever to be happy to no avail. Now that I am balanced I still have moments of despair but they are certainly farther apart. That young girl should have seen a doctor sooner. Were there no signs. I don't know. But I do know you have to treat the medical causes for depression first. I am so sorry for their loss. Thank you Cheri -- I'm glad to hear your doctor was so helpful and that you are now well. When our biochemistry is out of whack it can produce symptoms that can affect us in many ways, including mentally and emotionally, as you have shared with us here. Unfortunately, suicide is still a taboo subject for most, but I believe that if we are to turn this epidemic of loss around, we need to be able to discuss it and seek help. Just the other day I commented to a client that we make regular visits to our hairdresser and beauty therapist to maintain for our personal grooming, but for some unsound reason we do not see that our \"mental grooming\" is just as important."}

That exceeds the previous record of 412.8 billion set in 2008, which came just a few months before the financial crash from which the wider British economy has yet to recover. Heading the list for the seventh year running is the steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, although his wealth has fallen 4,814m to 12,700m, placing him just 385m ahead of Alisher Usmanov, whose Metalloinvest is Russia's biggest iron ore producer. Usmanov's fortune has also fallen, in his case by 85m in the past year, in part because of charitable donations of 91m. Third placed Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea FC has seen his wealth fall by 800m to 9,500m. But if the top three richest men in Britain have seen their fortunes slide, huge earnings elsewhere have fuelled this year's record total wealth. Efforts by hard-pressed families to make their wages go further during the economic downturn have boosted the fortunes of the owners of cut-price retail outlets. Liverpool-based Tom Morris and family, who own the Home Bargains stores, have seen their fortune leap from 160m to 620m. The B&M Retail discount chain, also based in the north west, has contributed to a 144m increase in the wealth of its owners, Simon, Robin and Bobby Arora, taking them to 487m and a place in the top 200. Some of the biggest gains have been made by those who do not fall in the billionaire bracket, or even those with fortunes of over 750m. The wealth of individuals with between 330m and 750m has gone up 7.8 per cent this year, with those worth 328m to 151m seeing their fortunes grow by 9 per cent. That compares to a rise of just 2.5 per cent in the wealth of the richest 100. There has been a sharp rise in the wealth of British-born entrepreneurs, with Laurence Graff, the diamond retailer, seeing his fortune go up 1,300m to 3,300m. The performance of the earth-moving machinery firm JCB saw the fortune of its owner Sir Anthony Bamford and family go up by 1,500m to 3,150m, while Sir James Dyson, the inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, saw his fortune increase by 1,200m to 2,650m. Topping the list of who, among Britain's richest individuals, are also the most generous philanthropists is the artist David Hockney. He has given away more than twice his residual wealth of 34m by donating works valued at 76.5m, as well as 730,000 in cash, through the David Hockney Foundation. Overall, donations or pledges from the top 100 philanthropists increased by 220m to 1.89 billion. That saw the amount of residual wealth donated by the top 100 richest people pass the milestone of at least one per cent for the first time in The Sunday Times Rich List's 11-year history. There have been notable changes in the fortunes of Britain's richest artists, entertainers and celebrities. Sir Paul McCartney, whose marriage to Nancy Shevell, the millionaire daughter of a US trucking magnate, has seen his estimated worth rocket from 495 to 665 million, making him the third-wealthiest man in British music. Ranked above him are Clive Calder, the music executive -- with a 1,350m fortune -- and Sir Cameron Mackintosh, whose wealth has grown by seven per cent to 725m. JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, has seen her wealth grow by 30m to 560m, placing her 148th on the list. Daniel Ek, the London-based owner of the music download site Spotify, makes his first appearance on the Rich List at 395, equalling the 190 million valuation of David and Victoria Beckham, who themselves added 25 million to their combined worth."}

Some days you start out and know right away that this is not going to be one of those days.  You hit the alarm one too many times, grab the toothpaste and realize that no matter how hard you squeeze you are not going to get one more blob out of that tube.  This sends you in a frantic search for that new tube that's got to be under this sink somewhere. Now you're quickly falling behind schedule which leaves you more anxious and any attempt to get caught up is futile.  Rushing to save a little time pouring that last cup of coffee before you leave the house will inevitably leave you with coffee spatter on your shirt.  Finally you resign yourself to the fact that it's just one of those mornings.  Luckily those mornings are balanced off by the ones that just roll out with unusual grace. You wake up before you've even hit the snooze button for a third time.  The sun is usually shining and before you know it you're ready to head out the door but stop for a second because, you're actually five minutes ahead of schedule.  You're not sure how it happened but it's a nice surprise.  You jump in the car and hear the traffic report on the radio and they say something to the effect of, \"we're not sure why but traffic volumes are much lighter than usual today\".  It's just one of those good days. There is balance between the good days and the bad days.  It may not always seem like it when you get into a bad stretch but, looking at the big picture, you've probably also had a good stretch at some time that you need to take into account.  The problem comes when that natural balance is disturbed by unnatural forces.  One of those unnatural forces is other members of our society inconveniencing all of us to send a message to the small group of people they want to reach, namely, politicians. Someone in some fringe special interest group gets it in their head that their problem should become our problem.  That the only way to get their message out is to get in our way and screw up our day.  The problem with these tactics is the way they undermine any support out there for their problems.  Canadians, by our nature, are a just and decent people.  We have great capacity to see the suffering and the injustice being done to others.  So that support should be encouraged and not thwarted by easy and intimidating actions so that you can get on the nightly news. Sending a message to government can be done in numerous ways and some of those might not involve getting society mad at you.  Democracy is built on the concept of majority rule and small constituencies with a beef would be well served to bring the majority of us on board. Get your message out, get the people on your side, which is not hard if your cause is just.  Then sit back and watch the politicians fold like one of those accordion buses when it turns a corner.  Inconvenience the masses and turn their seemingly good day into a bad one and all you do is squeeze us until there's no more support for you coming out of this tube."}

On Monday, The New York Times announced it would launch a Portuguese-language site based in Brazil starting in 2013. This follows up the Times' eastern expansion earlier this year with a Chinese-language edition . The setup in Sao Paulo will be similar to Beijing: The site will be a mix of translated articles from the Times and International Herald Tribune, alongside exclusive local content. From a production-cost perspective, going abroad makes a sense for larger media companies that can afford it. If you're publishing online, all you need is some staff, some translators, and office space. So why are media companies like the Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Financial Times set their sights on places like China and Brazil ? (And in the case of The FT, a print edition no less.) \"It is the largest economy in Latin America, and as such it is a natural focus for Americans,\" Joseph Kahn, the Times foreign editor, told me. A large economy that could mean another affluent audience to tap into for the Times and its advertisers. When the Times went into China, it lined up luxury brands like Cartier and Salvatore Ferragamo for launch. It's likely they would be looking for similar high-end, global advertisers for the Brazilian market. If they have reason to believe they will be successful in Brazil, it's because the Times already has some name recognition. Times stories are syndicated in Portuguese through Brazilian newspapers through The New York Times News Service . In choosing Brazil for its latest outpost, the Times gets a country with ties to the U.S., international attention (the World Cup and summer Olympics will be coming there), and an entry into the Portuguese language market. \"When you look at this specific country and foreign-language digital ventures, Portuguese is a very attractive language where we feel the western media is pretty lightly represented,\" Kahn said. Rosental Alves , director of the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas and a native of Brazil, said Portuguese offers more opportunity for expansion for the Times right now. While Spanish would have offered an entry to more markets, Alves said the varying dialects and regional differences would have made it difficult to write for a universal audience. More importantly, Alves said, Brazil is a home for a growing number of international companies. That gives the Times exposure to not just the local readers, but an international business audience. \"The economy is booming,\" he said. \"Like Sulzberger said yesterday in Sao Paulo , Brazil is the place to invest at the moment.\" But there are a number of obstacles in the Brazilian market, Alves said. People in Sao Paulo are heavy information consumers who already have a steady stream of choices for news, he said. One of the bigger players is Terra , an information-portal that reaches readers throughout South America, Alves said. At the moment, the Times is staffing up the Brazil site and plans to draw on Times reporters already located in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. It's a similar plan to the rollout in China. They'll add a number of translators and local writers to round out the staff. Kahn told me the China site has offered a number of lessons they can apply when expanding into other international news sites. \"We're learning a lot from the China site as we go along, in terms of what local readers who are not primarily English speakers are interested in reading from The New York Times,\" he said. One lesson from the China site, Kahn told me, is that readers wanted more news about China and Asia, even from an America media company. While that was expected, Kahn said they thought there would be more of an appetite for global and U.S. news as well. As a result, they are tinkering with their mix of local and international stories. But Kahn said each new location will offer different challenges.

If and when it happens across the country, it could lead to the formation of the new Chartered Professional Accountant designation. If you have been following this story, you'll remember from last year that CGA was part of these discussions. Now that you are back to classes, we thought it important to give you an open and frank update on where things stand. The majority of CGA Associations, with the exception of Quebec and Alberta, withdrew from the talks in the face of some fairly significant obstacles (you can read about them here ).  Due to a different regulatory structure in Quebec, the three bodies merged earlier in the summer. You may be hearing comments that the merger is a 'done deal' and that the new CPA model exists and is already enrolling students in B.C. The fact is that the merger is far from settled. In Ontario, home to 50 per cent of Canada's professional accountants, the merger is not happening. Both the CMAs and CGAs withdrew from talks and while the leadership of the Ontario CAs says they are committed to merging, there is strong opposition within the membership.   Regardless of jurisdiction, legislation will need to be introduced in each province to bring the CPA designation into effect. It is not even certain that governments would change legislation and, even if they did, it could take several years to accomplish. There would also be issues about what are called the old \"legacy designations\" and how and when existing students of those programs would transition into the new program. Now, while there may be benefits to a single accounting designation, there are certainly also advantages to having more than one professional body. We don't have to explain to commerce students and aspiring accountants about the benefits of competition and the advantages inherent to choice when it comes to selecting a degree or a professional program. After all, even our universities and colleges are fiercely competitive amongst themselves. No matter what happens in the profession, today, the path for CGA is clear. Whether there are two, three or four bodies, CGA offers a strong clear path to a proven professional career. The CGA advantages are as follows: With CGA there is no transition and no uncertainty. We offer  Canada's strongest and most flexible accounting curriculum, preparing  you for a career filled with success whether that's in industry, public accounting, government or the not-for-profit sector. Frankly, we feel the other programs are adapting to become more like us. And we see that as an affirmation of the strength of our program. However, we have a proven track record in many of the areas that is still uncharted territory for our competitors. CGA-BC provides incredible career support through our CGAjobs.org website and an array of CGA exclusive job fairs, interview nights and counseling for CGA students. With CGA's wide range of transfer credits, we offer the most open and flexible way to earn a professional accounting designation. CGA-BC is the market leader. In B.C. nearly two-thirds of the province's professional accounting students are taking CGA. That's twice as many students that would be in the CPA if it was up and running. CGA's flexible practical experience process allows students to choose where they want to work, and offers an open philosophy of learning.  Again, it's a model that is proven and it puts your career first. CGA provides career opportunities internationally especially as a result of our mutual recognition agreements with the ACCA, the world's fastest growing global accounting designation. Perhaps most of all, we are confident of CGA's well earned reputation for delivering the highest quality and best prepared business professional to the work force. Employers demand CGAs and CGA students and this will not change. For almost a decade now we have been identified as Canada's fastest growing accounting designation. Our business model is not dependent on a merger. Jas and I are sure that some of the ramifications of the merger -- especially when one tries to compare CGA's program to an unknown entity -- may be confusing for students making career choices. We hope that this information helps you find your way through the accounting maze. Rest assured that we  continue to do what we do best, namely offer the best professional accounting education program to meet the needs of business and students. And I assure you that we remain committed to providing you with the most up-to-date, spin-free information we can to empower you to make the choice that best meets your needs. 3 Responses to Sorting Through The Accounting Merger Maze One small question to ask about point #2: How was the Quebec government convinced to make the degree requirement an entry requirement and "}

Mr Sexstone, who now runs his own business consultancy, was responding to a pledge by Labour mayoral candidate Marvin Rees to bid for the games to come to the city if he is elected as mayor on Thursday. Mr Sexstone said: \"It's a very laudable idea and of course I would like to see the games in Bristol. \"But I just wonder if it has been properly costed out. At the very least, a new athletics stadium would be needed which would cost a minimum 100 million and where would it be built? \"I'm all for these kind of events -- I brought the cricket World Cup to Bristol in 1999 and helped to ensure that Bristol was selected as a host city for the 2018 World Cup but I just don't see how bringing the games here is achievable. \"It's a bright idea but I think you have to be realistic.\" Mr Sexstone backs Bristol 1st candidate George Ferguson to be the best mayor to improve sport in the city. Mr Sexstone said: \"In the past few years, both the Liberal Democrats and Labour have had a go at running the council and some of the party political candidates have made various pledges. \"But the fact of the matter is, they should have done years ago what they are now promising. \"I've been a sports administrator in Bristol for 16 years and I've had many dealings with the city council but frankly, I have absolutely no confidence that either Labour or the Liberal Democrats will be able to deliver on sport -- either in what they are saying or understand what the clubs and sports people want. \"That's why I am recommending to all sports people to give their support to George Ferguson. \"He has a strong business background and a track record for getting things done.\" Mr Sexstone said it should not be underestimated what professional sports clubs do for the community but this aspect of their work is often forgotten. He said: \"I know George Ferguson has done a lot of work in the community and fully appreciates the role of sports clubs.\" On Friday, The Post revealed that Mr Rees wants to bring the Commonwealth Games to Bristol in 2022 or 2026. His pledge has received the backing of both professional football clubs, Bristol Rugby Club and a number of leading sports people in the city. Mr Rees has said: \"Britain saw the huge impact that the Olympics had on the whole country but particularly on London and it is time for Bristol to reach out with similar ambition.\" He said the process to win the Games would start with a feasibility study before submitting a formal bid. He said that even if the bid was not successful, it would raise the profile of the city. Smaller cities have held the Games in the past, such as Victoria in Canada in 1994."}

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] Maryland has an area of 12,406.68 square miles (32,133.2 km 2 ) and is comparable in overall area with the European country of Belgium (11,787 square miles (30,530 km 2 )). [ 16 ] It is the 42nd largest and 9th smallest state and is closest in size to the state of Hawaii (10,930.98 square miles (28,311.1 km 2 )), the next smallest state. The next largest state, its neighbor West Virginia , is almost twice the size of Maryland (24,229.76 square miles (62,754.8 km 2 )). Maryland possesses a variety of topography within its borders, contributing to its nickname America in Miniature . [ 17 ] It ranges from sandy dunes dotted with seagrass in the east, to low marshlands teeming with wildlife and large bald cypress near the Chesapeake Bay, to gently rolling hills of oak forests in the Piedmont Region , and pine groves in the mountains to the west. Most of the state's waterways are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, with the exceptions of a tiny portion of extreme western Garrett County (drained by the Youghiogheny River as part of the watershed of the Mississippi River ), the eastern half of Worcester County (which drains into Maryland's Atlantic coastal bays), and a small portion of the state's northeast corner (which drains into the Delaware River watershed). So prominent is the Chesapeake in Maryland's geography and economic life that there has been periodic agitation to change the state's official nickname to the Bay State , a nickname that has been used by Massachusetts for decades. The highest point in Maryland, with an elevation of 3,360 feet (1,020 m), is Hoye Crest on Backbone Mountain , in the southwest corner of Garrett County , near the border with West Virginia and near the headwaters of the North Branch of the Potomac River. Close to the small town of Hancock , in western Maryland, about two-thirds of the way across the state, there is 1.83 miles (2.95 km) between its borders. This geographical curiosity makes Maryland the narrowest state, [ citation needed ] bordered by the Mason-Dixon Line to the north, and the northwards-arching Potomac River to the south. Portions of Maryland are included in various official and unofficial geographic regions. For example, the Delmarva Peninsula is composed of the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland, the entire state of Delaware , and the two counties that make up the Eastern Shore of Virginia , whereas the westernmost counties of Maryland are considered part of Appalachia . Much of the Baltimore–Washington corridor lies just south of the Piedmont in the Coastal Plain, [ 18 ] though it straddles the border between the two regions. There are no natural lakes, [ 19 ] though there are numerous ponds . During the latter Ice Ages , the glaciers did not reach as far south as Maryland, and therefore they did not carve out the deep natural lakes that exist in states farther north. There are numerous man-made lakes, the largest of these being the Deep Creek Lake , a reservoir in Garrett County in westernmost Maryland. The lack of a glacial history also accounts for Maryland's soil, which is sandier and muddier than the rocky soils farther to the north and northeast. Maryland has a wide array of climates, due to local variances in elevation, proximity to water, and protection from colder weather due to downslope winds . The eastern half of Maryland lies on the Atlantic Coastal Plain , with very flat topography and very sandy or muddy soil. This region has a humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa ), with hot, humid summers and a short, mild to cool winter; it falls under USDA Hardiness zone 8a. [ 20 ] However, in spite of its subtropical designation, there can be intervening periods of much more intense cold when weather patterns in Pennsylvania and even farther North shift temporarily Southward. This happens a number of times every winter. Blizzards also occur every few years. This region includes the cities of Ocean City , Salisbury , Annapolis , and the southern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore . Farther into western Maryland, the higher elevations of Allegany County and Garrett County display more characteristics of the humid continental zone, due in part to elevation, and are more similar to that of south-central Pennsylvania, including the cities of Cumberland , Frostburg , and Oakland . They fall under USDA Hardiness zones 6b and below. [ 20 ] Precipitation in the state is characteristic of the East Coast. Annual rainfall ranges from 35 to 45 inches (890 to 1,140 mm) with more in higher elevations. Nearly every part of Maryland receives 3.5–4.5 inches (89–114 mm) per month of rain.

At the moment I think F1 is just too expensive for them. It would be great to see them back in F1 though. They were essentially responsible for Brawn's success in 2009. If they come back with a \"real\" effort, then I would also like to see this. Although I have never owned a Honda, their participation in the 80's and 90's made me have a very positive view of the company and its brands. Back then, had I been in the market for car in a class made by Honda or Acura, I would have certainly considered those brands based partially on that fondness. I'm considering a Honda Ridgeline Sport pickup now. Maybe they'll make a decision that will sway me. Being a cynic I see nothing new here. A big car maker says if the conditions are right, the rules are good, the costs are low, the marketing opportunities are there and if the tea leaves are aligned the right way then they might think about getting back into F1.

All the direct quotes from Yamamoto are about a potential return at some unspecified point in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if the \"considering a return in 2014\" bit is a complete fabrication. I'm not familiar with that particular site, but it looks to me like their standard of journalism is more PlanetF1 than Autosport. Has anyone seen the interview in Autocar that's referred to in the piece? If the current engine formula remained, Honda could come back very quickly. I mean they've got a pretty good V8 engine in the warehouse, other manufacturers haven't developed that much after they left because of the engine freeze. I think the last statement summarizes the article: ?This is my [Yoshiharu Yamamoto] personal view ? not that of Honda ? but I feel the first thing we must do is win in the WTCC, and then perhaps we can look further afield.? A few weeks ago I was telling a friend to watch out for Honda's return to F1 in the new engine rules, after all it's a turbo engine with fuel restrictions, and those of us who go back a few years will know that Honda dominated both F1 and Indycar / CART / Champcar racing with turbo engines running to fuel restrictions.

Perhaps. Maybe. The same applies for every car company I can think of, its non-news to me. Yeah, same old thing - get in while it suits you and then leave when you aren't winning everthing. Not impossible really. I mean I've seen enough stuff lately to say Vodafone will not be in F1 much longer and that Mercedes and McLaren are going to part company fairly soon. Certainly I would already be in talks with Honda for 2014 and beyond if I was a team manager. It would be good to see Honda back IF they were prepared to stick around for a while. Quite frankly, F1 can do without manufacturers if they are going to come into the sport and then leave again within five years. Yellow journalism at its best. The article contains just four sentences and the news can't be confirmed or denied. I do wonder, is 8 million quid so dear for McLaren that they'd be willing to destroy a 20 year long relationship with Mercedes and its race and championship winning engine? PS: Ok, past 2013 this will be a clean sheet design engine, so perhaps it could make sense to roll the dice with Honda, if McLaren get's Honda's engine for free. Yes but the alternator had been changed for Brazil. It has passed all the tests and was used by all Renault teams excepting Red Bull at the last GP.

It's a pretty sober look at the difficulties the world is facing in producing enough oil to meet demand. The conclusions are inescapable: we can't produce enough oil and a cycle of oil-driven recessions is coming. Are our leaders finally waking up to the impeding crisis of peak oil? Low-cost reserves of oil are being rapidly exhausted, forcing oil companies to turn to more expensive sources of oil. This replacement of low-cost sources of oil with higher costs sources is driving the price of oil higher. While the world will not run out of oil reserves for decades to come, it cannot indefinitely continue to produce oil at an increasing rate from the remaining reserves. Forecasts indicate that world oil production capacity will not grow or fall in the next five years while demand will continue to rise. If oil production capacity does not rise as fast as demand, the buffer of spare production capacity disappears. In such a 'supply crunch' the price of oil 'spikes' to high levels. High oil prices can induce global recessions. Organisations including the International Energy Agency and the US military have warned that another supply crunch is likely to occur soon after 2012 due to rising demand and insufficient production capacity. There is a risk that the world economy may be at the start of a cycle of supply crunches leading to price spikes and recessions, followed by recoveries leading to supply crunches. New Zealand is heavily dependent on oil imports and will remain so for the foreseeable future. While there is potential to substantially increase domestic production, domestic oil production cannot insulate New Zealand from global oil price shocks because New Zealand pays the world price for goods like oil. Key export-generating industries in the New Zealand economy including tourism and timber, dairy, and meat exports are very vulnerable to oil shocks because of their reliance on affordable international transport. If you're familiar with the basics of peak oil then most of the paper will be covering old ground and if anyone still doubts it's going to happen, check out the list of quotes from international organisations: The US Joint Forces Command forecasts that: \"by 2012, surplus oil production capacity could entirely disappear, and as early as 2015, the shortfall in output could reach nearly10mb/d.\" The UK Industry Task Force on Peak Oil and Energy Security predicts: \"as early as2012/2013 and no later than 2014/2015, oil prices are likely to spike, imperilling economic growth and causing economic dislocation.\" Lloyds of London says: \"an oil crunch is likely in the short to medium term\" and \"appears likely around 2013.\" A German military report states: \"some probability that peak oil will occur around the year 2010 and that the impact on security is expected to be felt 15 to 30 years later... [there will be] \"partial or complete failure of markets... [including] shortages in the supply of vital goods could arise.. A restructuring of oil supplies will not be equally possible in all regions before the onset of peak oil.\" The IEA writes: \"current global trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable...the era of cheap oil is over.\" But the section on the economic implications is what really caught my eye: As demand rises faster than production capacity, the world's oil supply buffer is whittled away. The supply crunch raises the price. Once the price reaches a certain level it tips economies into recession. This lowers demand, recreating the supply buffer, and results in a lower price. This enables economies to recover, which increases their oil demand, which decreases the supply buffer, and so on. Once production capacity starts to fall, rising demand will eat up the supply buffer at lower and lower levels... ...Rather than a single sharp period of economic decline following the point where oil production starts to fall, what analysts are calling a 'corrugated plateau' or 'undulating plateau' could take place: a cycle of successive periods of growth, supply crunch/price spikes, recessions, and recovery leading to the next supply crunch, all underlain by a rising cost base driven by the exhaustion of cheap reserves... ... As a country that is reliant on oil imports and heavily dependent on cheap oil for its major sources of income, New Zealand is highly exposed to oil shocks. Domestic oil production is insufficient to meet New Zealand's oil needs. Equally, increasing domestic oil production would not protect New Zealand from either the direct or indirect effects of price spikes caused by global supply crunches. The Government is not unaware of the coming oil crisis. It's just that its solution is stupid: build more roads and hope to dig up more oil for the cars while saying \"Ultimately uptake of new energy sources and technologies will depend on the decisions made by consumers as they respond "}

We arrived on Monday the 29th after a 30 hour journey. The flights were uneventful (just how you want them!) although we did miss our connecting flight in Jo'burg to Durban. We had less than two hours when we arrived to catch our domestic flight -- impossible, even if we had known exactly where to go in the airport. By the time we went through immigration and ran at top speed to collect our bags the flight was closed, never mind that we still had to check in for the domestic flight and go through security as well as get to the gate. Anyway we went to the South African Airways desk to get onto another flight to Durban and were told we would have to pay. We explained that the airline had chosen the connecting flight time not us and we missed it because of the wait at immigration, that was met with shrugs and instructions to go to the other side of the airport to the Singapore Airlines desk to get them to sort it. Singapore Airlines then told us to go to South African Airways to have them sort it!  We dug our heels in, so after waiting in several more queues and going back and forth with Singapore Airlines they agreed they had not given us the standard minimum two hour transit time so they gave us a voucher and sent us back across the airport to South African Airways again, this time success, and we were on another flight to Durban. We arrived in Durban and it was great to see Val (Olly's friend from when he worked in Lesotho) waiting for us. She whisked us to her place and has been a wonderful hostess! Landy is still on the water and we got in touch with Maurita (the local shipping agent) to get the latest, and let her know we are in Durban and to please keep us updated on any landy news. We are both anxious for her to arrive (safe and well). At this stage she is still scheduled to arrive on time (5th Nov) The last few days we have both been pretty shattered with jet lag, the time difference is now only a few hours from the UK and I always feel half dead for the first few days when we go there.  We are both very tired in the morning and early evening but ok during the day and I'm feeling brilliant about 2 am! Its been rainy (and much more humid than Sydney, more like Qld) and have been happy to mostly hang around Val's house. Val has been so warm and welcoming and so helpful! We went to get a sim card for our internet and phone, that turned out to take half the day! We expected to need our passports but were not expecting to need proof of address (or if staying at a hotel they could write us a letter saying how long we are staying and then they would have to take the letter the police station to be witnessed and stamped, what hotel would do that?!) anyway Val was happy to just buy them for us, we have assured her we will not engage in criminal activity with them! I have spent ages on the phone and internet to hire us a car and book some accommodation as we have decided to go away for 6 days while we wait for landy. It's not exactly in the budget but it's too long to stay in Durban and we are itching to get out and see things! For some reason booking places and the car have taken ages, but its all sorted now and we are leaving tomorrow for St Lucia (up the coast) and then on to some game reserves.  We have been chatting with Val this afternoon about game reserves and animals very exciting! It's also been great to hear lots of stories about Murdoch (Val's husband who passed away last year) from Val and Olly. It's such a shame I did not get to meet him but I feel like I'm getting a bit of his character. We will be back to Durban Tuesday afternoon in the meantime here are a few Sydney photos. L This wasn't planned, but a happy coincidence as we were walking through the city centre. Tom is still campaigning, go Tom Out and about walking around the harbour, one of our favourite Sydney things to do. Hey you two, this all sounds amazing. what an adventure just as you planned/ Just wanted to say thanks for staying in touch this year. It's been a tough one. Still we gotta keep going.

One resort has had an idea. Cost is one factor but some say skiing and snowboarding is not as attractive as it once was. For teenagers and young adults there are plenty of other adrenalin fixes out there - from biking and bunjee jumping to triathlons and treadmills. It is a concern facing the industry. If children do not ski and snowboard now, and get hooked on the sport, they may not take it up at a later date. Repeat business from childhood experience is an important long-term reason for adults taking to the slopes. Some resorts have recognised this and are going the extra mile. Avoriaz in the Portes du Soleil is targeting youngsters with a special 'Learn To Snowboard' scheme. It is copying an idea from the USA using a teaching method adapted to young children. The snowboard manufacturer, Burton, and the resort's \"Village des Enfants\"  have joined forces with a new initiative.  It is not a startlingly original but it does apparently work. Getting them young From 15th December in the centre of the resort Burton is opening a \"Riglet Park\": a snowy play zone designed to introduce children from three years old to snowboarding. The concept saw significant success in major American resorts last winter including  Smuggler's Notch and Mountain Creek in Vermont, Canyons Resort in Utah and the Californian resort of Sierra at Tahoe. Here is a video of the Riglet Park from the Canyons resort. It aims to make snowboarding fun in a safe environment. There  is a raised platform with ramps for children to slide down. The platform is equipped with a \"stay-steady\" area to give children their first taste of balancing. Riglet Park is designed for riding small gradients, mini rails, pyramids and mini half-pipes so children can develop their reflexes and find their balance on turns and steeper terrain. On the snow, children are equipped with specialised Burton equipment, featuring a retractable strap attached to the snowboard that allows the instructor to guide the child easily. This makes for rapid progress through the various modules. This new concept strikes a chord with everything that Annie Famose has been doing for 35 years at the Village des Enfants says the resort: making sure children have fun while they learn in a 5-hectare snow garden, with special mini-pistes with bumps, slides, coloured tracks, jumps, a rope-tow and beginners' drag-lift. Parents and older children can watch and admire - or go skiing and snowboarding themselves in the huge Portes du Soleil ski area. Avoriaz is one of the best resorts in the Alps for families and recently it won the award for the best family resort in the World Snow Awards - we reported on the awards ceremony here on PlanetSKI. Avoriaz has a huge _200m programme of improvements for this winter that we will be reporting on later on PlanetSKI as the season gets underway."}

Scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher in Switzerland say they have discovered what could be the long-sought Higgs boson, a subatomic particle dubbed the \"God particle\" because it is believed to have originated during the Big Bang and helped shape the subatomic particles that make up all matter in the universe. Rolf Heuer, director of the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Meyrin, Switzerland, near the border with France, made the announcement early Wednesday, saying that researchers \"have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics.\" He described the discovery as a boson, a broader class of subatomic particle, but stopped short of confirming that it's a Higgs boson -- an extremely fine distinction. \"As a layman, I think we did it,\" he said. \"We have observed a new particle that is consistent with a Higgs boson.\" The Higgs boson has been labelled the \"God particle\" in the mainstream media because of the fundamental questions it could answer about matter and the creation of the universe, and although most physicists avoid using the term, they do agree that the Higgs boson plays a key role in what is known as the Standard Model of particle physics, which describes the particles from which everything in the universe is made and how they interact. Theory 1st proposed in 1960s The Standard Model includes common subatomic particles like electrons and protons along with less familiar ones like muons. The Higgs boson is the only one that remains undetected in experiments because it lives for only a tiny fraction of a second before decaying into other subatomic particles, such as photons, muons or leptons. The only way to measure it is to measure the products of its decay. The reason physicists have been so determined to find the Higgs boson is because it is believed to impart mass to all the other fundamental particles. \"It's important to realize it's not responsible for most of the mass we are made of, but it's involved in the mass of fundamental particles,\" explained Itay Yavin, assistant professor of physics at McMaster University in Hamilton, in a briefing about the discovery prepared by the Science Media Centre. \"It plays an important role, and it's needed to make the Standard Model consistent, but it's not much more important than other particles -- it's the last ingredient in this beautiful puzzle called the Standard Model.\" A graphic showing the decay of a possible Higgs boson into four muons in a 2012 particle collision conducted inside the Large Hadron Collider by the ATLAS team of CERN scientists. (ATLAS/CERN) The existence of a Higgs boson was first proposed by British physicist Peter Higgs and his colleagues at Edinburgh University in 1964 as a way of explaining how particles gained mass, a property that at first did not seem to fit into the Standard Model of how electrons and protons interact. Higgs proposed that particles gain mass by interacting with a medium, or Higgs field, that exists everywhere in space and is made up of unseen particles called bosons. Higgs's theory does not assign a specific mass to the boson itself but gives a range of values for the potential masses it could have. Based on these values, physicists can determine the amount of secondary particles that the boson decays into that they should expect to find when observing high-speed particle collisions. P.O.V. This is the \"footprint\" of the Higgs boson that scientists said they found when analysing trillions of high-speed proton-proton collisions within CERN's Large Hadron Collider . The CERN physicists conducted two separate but parallel experiments over 2011 and 2012 using two particle-collision detectors called ATLAS and CMS that are part of the collider. The scientists said data from both detectors gave \"strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the Higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts [about 130 times the mass of a proton].\" TRIUMF physicists involved in hunt Wednesday's announcement follows decades of work and billions of dollars spent on a project that has involved scientists in dozens of countries, including more than 100 in Canada. To mark the occasion in Canada, a few dozen physicists and other experts at TRIUMF, a particle physics lab in Vancouver that has been involved with the hunt for the Higgs boson, gathered overnight to celebrate . Read more \"It's a big day for CERN, a big day for international science, and a big day for science in Canada,\" said Oliver Stelzer-Chilton, a physicist at the TRIUMF lab. \"But now, we have to come to the bottom of it,\" he said. \"What is nature telling us that this new particle is?\" \"At this point, we can say it's consistent with the properties that we expect from a Higgs boson, but we basically have to measure those properties to be sure.\" Although CERN said the discovery met the high experimental "}

The U.S. Naval Observatory notes that the Earth reached its orbital point called \"aphelion\" at 12 a.m. EDT on Thursday, July 5. That distance is approximately 94.5 million miles away from the sun. The sun is typically 93 million miles from Earth however the Earth's orbit around the sun is not a circle but rather an ellipse which means it has a farthest and a closest point. The suns closest point to the sun known as the perihelion is experienced in early January. The sun during aphelion is 3,104,641 miles farther from the sun than during the perihelion phase. Despite receiving 7 percent less radiant heat during this period we continue to experience record heat. The reason for the continued heat is that the current warm weather is tied to the Earth's 23.5-degree tilt which puts the sun above the horizon for varying lengths of time during the different seasons. The tilt of Earth determines how the sun's rays strike each place on earth based on a direct or low angle approach to Earth. \"At the latitude of New York City, the sun's direct rays on the June 21 summer solstice mean the city receives three times as much heat as it does during the winter solstice in late December. The reverse is true for the Southern Hemisphere, where it is currently winter.\""}

She joined the Queens County District Attorney's Office in 1974, where she headed the new Special Victims Bureau that dealt with sex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. She was elected to the House in 1978, where she rose rapidly in the party hierarchy while focusing on legislation to bring equity for women in the areas of wages, pensions, and retirement plans. In 1984, former vice president and presidential candidate Walter Mondale selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election . In doing so she became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee in addition to being the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined faded as questions about her and her husband's finances arose. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush . Ferraro was born in Newburgh, New York , [ 1 ] the daughter of Antonetta L. Ferraro (née Corrieri), a first-generation Italian American seamstress, and Dominick Ferraro, an Italian immigrant (from Campania ) and owner of two restaurants. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] She had three brothers born before her, but one died in infancy and another at age three. [ 4 ] Ferraro attended the parochial school Mount Saint Mary's in Newburgh when she was young. [ 6 ] Her father died of a heart attack in May 1944 , when she was eight. [ 7 ] Ferraro's mother soon invested and lost the remainder of the family's money, forcing the family to move to a low-income area in the South Bronx while Ferraro's mother worked in the garment industry to support them. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] [ 8 ] Ferraro stayed on at Mount Saint Mary's as a boarder for a while, then briefly attended a parochial school in the South Bronx. [ 9 ] Beginning in 1947, she attended and lived at the parochial Marymount Academy in Tarrytown, New York , using income from a family rental property in Italy and skipping seventh grade. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] At Marymount Ferraro was a member of the honor society , active in several clubs and sports, voted most likely to succeed, [ 4 ] and graduated in 1952. [ 11 ] Her mother was adamant that she get a full education, [ 12 ] despite an uncle in the family saying, \"Why bother? She's pretty. She's a girl. She'll get married.\" [ 13 ] Ferraro attended Marymount Manhattan College with a scholarship [ 4 ] while sometimes holding two or three jobs at the same time. [ 14 ] During her senior year she began dating John Zaccaro of Forest Hills, Queens , who had graduated from Iona College with a commission in the U.S. Marine Corps . [ 15 ] Ferraro received a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1956; [ 8 ] she was the first woman in her family to gain a college degree. [ 15 ] She also passed the city exam to become a licensed school teacher. [ 15 ] Ferraro became engaged to Zaccaro in August 1959 [ 10 ] and married him on July 16 , 1960. [ 19 ] He became a realtor and businessman. [ 8 ] She kept her birth name professionally, as a way to honor her mother for having supported the family after her father's death, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] but used his name in parts of her private life. [ 20 ] The couple had three children, Donna (born 1962), John Jr. (born 1964), and Laura (born 1966). [ 19 ] They lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens , and in 1971, added a vacation house in Saltaire on Fire Island . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] They would buy a condominium in Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1983. [ 21 ] [ 23 ] While raising the children, Ferraro worked part-time as a civil lawyer in her husband's real estate firm for 13 years. [ 17 ] She also occasionally worked for other clients and did some pro bono work for women in family court . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] She spent time at local Democratic clubs, which allowed her to maintain contacts within the legal profession and become involved in local politics and campaigns. [ 24 ] While organizing community opposition to a proposed building, Ferraro met lawyer and Democratic figure Mario Cuomo , who became a political mentor. [ 26 ] In 1970, she was elected president of the Queens County Women's Bar Association. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Ferraro's first full-time political job came in January 1974 , when she was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York , [ 29 ] by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. [ 17 ] At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. [ 17 ] Grumblings that she was the beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. [ 17 ] The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. [ 17 ] [ 29 ] She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. [ 17 ] In this role, "}

The Germans held the high ground. The Canadians had two British divisions on their right, and two French army divisions on their left. On April 22, after an artillery bombardment, the Germans released 5700 cylinders of chlorine gas. The green chlorine gas was heavier than air and sank into the trenches forcing soldiers out. The gas attack was followed by strong infantry assaults. The French defences were forced to retreat, leaving a four-mile wide hole in the Allied line. The Germans did not have enough reserves or protection against the chlorine gas for their own troops to take immediate advantage of the gap. The Canadians fought through the night to close the gap. On the first night, the Canadians launched a counter-attack to drive the Germans out of Kitchener's Wood near St. Julien. The Canadians cleared the woods, but had to retire. More attacks that night resulted in disastrous casualties, but bought some time to close the gap. Two days later the Germans attacked the Canadian line at St. Julien, again using chlorine gas. The Canadians held on until reinforcements arrived."}

What to do With Weber and Diaz? Excuse me for laughing at the question, but isn't it a bit premature to ask fans if they're satisfied with Marc Bergevin's work in unrestricted free agency? Can't count the amount of responses slinging mud at Bergevin for not \"handling\" Scott Gomez and Tomas Kaberle, and Rene Bourque, and for not picking up a top six forward. As if the market is now completely bare, a mere four days into free agency. Were the Canadiens interested in Jagr? Of course they were. And when you hear Bergevin slough it off and suggest \"the fit wasn't right\", it's nothing more than a counter to the argument that some would make; that the Canadiens lost out to another team in the race. Now that we know the truth, that Jagr was able to bilk $4.55 million out of Dallas, we know that the price was much higher than Bergevin was willing to pay. It was likely higher than anyone else wanted to pay, as well, despite Petr Svoboda's claim that his client received 20-odd offers. As for \"fit\" with the Canadiens, can't really see who would've fit better. Not suggesting Bergevin should've paid the price, but on a one-year term, who would you prefer to have next to Tomas Plekanec and Brian Gionta? He was an attractive commodity because he was a short-term solution, one that could fill the seats and bring excitement to the Bell Centre; one that could produce and help the team bust out of the cellar of the East. Instead, Bergevin will have to creatively find his man, most likely through trade. And through that avenue, he's more likely to find a long-term solution. What would the Canadiens have to give to get Bobby Ryan? Could Lars Eller + (I'm open to suggestion) be an attractive package to the Ducks who are interested in obtaining a second line centre? Would you be willing to ship David Desharnais or Tomas Plekanec their way? Could the Canadiens have a pitch for one of the remaining free agents? Someone that fills the short-term solution mold? ********** Have to wonder what the future holds for Raphael Diaz and for Yannick Weber. Will either be a member of the Canadiens next season? What about Frederic St-Denis? Will he have a chance to grab a spot? And Brendan Nash? Could Greg Pateryn be in the immediate plans? Can't help but feel the Canadiens need to find another nasty defenseman to round out the bottom end of that picture."}

It certainly dates back at least to British officer Robert Grainger Ker Thompson , strategist of the British counter-insurgency efforts against the Malayan National Liberation Army during the Malayan Emergency , 1948-1960 (see entry). The term is also associated with General William Westmoreland and the United States' intervention in Vietnam, particularly the large force increase from 1965-1968. The term is used to convey the belief that military success can only be achieved through the direct physical presence of troops in a conflict area. As terminology, it was coined to concisely express a counter-view against the position that other means, such as aerial bombardment (as used both by Germany and the Allies in World War II, and massively by the United States in Vietnam), economic incentives, or satellite intelligence could achieve victory. The term is particularly applied currently (2010) to counter-insurgency operations. Boots on the Ground... is an account of the war in Iraq with the 2nd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne as it convoys north from Kuwait to Iraq's Tallil Air Base en route to night-and-day battles within the major city of Samawah and its bridges across the Euphrates . Zinsmeister, a frontline reporter embedded with the 82nd Airborne, seeks to convey the detailed planning and technical execution that make up today's warfare . The book brings to life local firefights and the constant air-ground interactions that are one of the key innovations of modern precision combat. Karl Zinsmeister wrote Boots while working as editor of The American Enterprise . In May 2006, he was appointed the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. He is a J.B. Fuqua Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , where his research has spanned demographic and social trends, economics , politics , and cultural topics.

Oddly enough, we aren't moving out of our community because rents in the DFW area have gone crazy the last two months. This is what happens when people can't get loans for a home. Everyone turns to renting. At least that's my theory. I was getting alerts every day about houses where the status was either getting updated because they had rented in less than 24 hours or their price was going up by hundreds of dollars a month, pricing them right out of our budget. So we decided that unless there's a big promotion or something, our budget is better served by staying put, sort of. I called a friend from around here who's home was empty. She was not sure she wanted to rent it, but made a sudden turn around. It's got 6 acres, room for Lily and a companion. ?? Tall ceilings like our home, open living room too. ?? We also have a lovely creek in the backyard... Right now, it's got water... Come on rain! The place needs a serious mowing since plants are about as high as my hip. We've got a friend with a tractor and we're hoping to borrow it to do some shredding. The rent is affordable, she has no issue with our crazy number of animals. It's a dream, at least for a year. Now I just need to get hubby home. All in due time. It's interesting, this place is very much in line with my dream and when I think of the gyrations it took to get here I'm amazed. Other issues have arisen (I may be up for a new job, or not, our work department is losing cohesion, Hubby loves his job and wishes he could find a  way to stay). Congratulations. You sound happy with how it's working out. I couldn't believe that my old house got under contract within a week of it being on the market. They weren't supposed to even show it until the painting and flooring was done. I talked to the painter today and he said it looks fantastic. He cleaned up a lot of cracks and rotting drywall. Now I'm kind of wishing I weren't selling it. If I rent it, maybe someday I can go back to it, after the annoying, nosy old folks next door move along. But I'm selling it to an Army Captain, so at least I can feel good about helping out a service member. Breathe - That's good forward movement. I hope that Lily is feeling better. Lisa's suggestion on the other post about the nerve block was a good one. Also, have you tried a good chiropractor for her? It's so hard to know what to do when you don't really know what's wrong.

The Social Issues Do Democrats engage in soul-searching after they lose an election? Maybe I miss it because I'm not a Democrat, but it doesn't seem that they do. After John Kerry lost in 2004, did Democrats agonize over whether they should stop opposing the war in Iraq, or become pro-abortion? When Democrats were \"shellacked,\" as President Obama put it, in 2010, did they debate whether they should come up with a coherent plan to deal with the debt and start adopting budgets? Not that I recall. We Republicans are different. Whenever we lose an election, you can be sure two things will happen: one group, which consists mostly of Democrats but includes some Republicans, will say it is time to give up on the social issues. Another group (this time all Republicans) will say that the party needs to nominate purer conservatives. These critiques come from the left and the right, respectively. As for nominating purer conservatives, I see no evidence that the 2012 electorate rejected Mitt Romney and other Republicans because it hungered for more hard-line right-wing nominees. I wrote more about this here . But with respect to the social issues, I think the time has come for Republicans to refine our approach. Let's start with a bit of history. Contemporary conservatism is largely defined by Ronald Reagan, who united various strands of the movement in the \"three-legged stool\": economic conservatism, manifested by free-market policies; foreign policy conservatism, manifested by a strong national defense; and social conservatism, manifested by...what? In Reagan's time, the main social issues were crime and welfare. It is easy to forget, at a distance of more than 30 years, how large a role these issues played in Reagan's career and in the political debates of the time. Politically, conservatives won the battles over crime and welfare. Our cities (save only Detroit) were saved by tough law enforcement, and AFDC was repealed in the historic welfare reform act. Since the 1990s, neither crime nor welfare has figured prominently as an issue in national elections. Starting in the 1990s and 2000s, when people talked about the social issues, they basically meant abortion. Republicans had generally opposed abortion all along, but it was a secondary issue; politicians like Reagan rarely talked about it. But with crime and welfare mostly off the table as political issues, abortion became the issue that defined social conservatism. Then, within the last decade, gay marriage -- an idea that was virtually non-existent in Reagan's time -- has suddenly become a prominent issue. When we talk about the social issues today, we mean, pretty much exclusively, abortion and gay marriage. It seems obvious that the evolution of social issues from crime and welfare to abortion and gay marriage has hurt the Republican Party. Crime and welfare were serious public policy issues that could be, and were, debated from empirical premises. Abortion and gay marriage are moral, largely religious issues, and are less amenable to public policy debate. They are, for reasons that are entirely understandable, governed more by emotion than by empirical data. A great many people are heartily sick of these issues and wish they would go away, while others view them as matters of moral duty that are key to the ultimate survival of our civilization. Whether you agree with the latter perspective or not, it seems clear that contemporary conservatives have reached a dead end in their approach to the social issues. If we want to do better in future elections, we need, I think, to recalibrate our approach -- by which I do not mean adopting liberal positions. It seems useful to begin with the observation that abortion and gay marriage stand on very different footings. Abortion is an accomplished fact, and has been since the early 1970s. Millions upon millions of babies have been legally aborted since Roe v. Wade , for better or worse. With abortion established as a constitutional right, the overwhelming majority of office-holders have little or nothing to do with it, one way or another. It is beyond me why any voter should care about what a candidate for the House or the Senate, or for governor or a state legislature, thinks about abortion. It is equally hard to understand why such candidates would make support for abortion, or opposition to it, a significant part of their platforms. The issue remains alive in large part because Democrats are constantly warning that Republican candidates will do away with \"a woman's right to choose.\" This was, of course, part of the absurd war on women theme. But to be fair, Democrats get away with such efforts partly because many Republican candidates insist on talking about abortion as if it were a live issue. Since candidates on both sides raise the issue largely for political reasons, it makes sense to try to frame it in the most politically useful way. What does that mean for Republicans? First, th"}

It's been difficult to get out and have free time during sunlight hours.  Hopefully, I'll have some new cold-weather photos next week. Here's some photos from last Friday [or maybe the Friday before that?] of some band that was on the Tulane Quad.  They were pretty rockin', but I forget what their name was -- either way, here's some of the photos.  I kept one to use in the next-week photo project thing. A few of you have commented on the general bland-ness of my recent photos -- and you all have a point!  In fact, for my high-quality uploads [which can be found here ] I usually pick my top two favorite photos of the week that I've shot and post them there as well; the last few weeks have seen nearly no uploads to 500px!  I just haven't looked at one of my photos lately and said, \"Wow!  That's neat.\"  A bit upsetting, but it's good to admit when you're in an artistic rut. Hopefully, then, this week will be better.  I've included some weirdo photos (the one with the lights is from riding down the road on my bike and doing a longer-exposure; the blurry bee got me stung afterwards.  Bees are not very nice.) as well as some alternates from the last two weeks (the bug, the flower).  I've always wanted to take a decent photo of my eye, and this is the best one I've got so far.  I wish I could decrease the reflection and make it a bit closer, but it was hard enough shooting this one: one thing that I learned, for example, is that if you get close enough to your eye, it will expand and contract SLIGHTLY with your heart-beat and this is JUST ENOUGH to blur the image if you aren't using a crazy amount of light.  That's why my pupil is so small in the photo. Last, I wanted to explain the acorn photo, since it is pretty unremarkable: I took two photos (one with a focus near, one with a focus far) and attempted to photoshop them together (you can see this if you look at my little squiggle on the left-hand-side of the photo); this was just practice for working with some other macro stuff -- since there is such a SMALL depth of field, I can usually get a bug's head and a bug's body, but not both at the same time.  Hence, overlapping. Either way, enjoy and let me know what you think.  The weather is getting cooler, and Nanowrimo is next week-ish, so expect some artsy photos from slightly farther away from my house! Here's some bonus pictures in addition to the week's photos below.  I posted a few band pictures in this week's photos, but here's the whole set.  I don't remember the name of this band, but they were pretty good [the SOMETHING brothers, I think.  Very country-ish] but if you know it, lemme know. This week marks the first week that all of my photos aren't of leaves and little things I find on the road.  This week we have: some views of the campus, one of the singers in some band I can't remember the name off, a happenin' dog and a weird accidental shot of a bug that I liked, some low-light light-play, and this weird picture I accidentally took at the table, but if you look close you can see a little spider going up on my water bottle.  Neat."}

Similar ones are used in Europe, with much higher occupancy. I'm sure if it works there, it'll work here. While I hear you about the snow, we do clean the roads here. Plus it's not like they're not used in countries where it snows. It's longer though and SHOULD hold more people. No streetcar design in the world is going to force people back though. So basically we have a larger streetcar that seats and stands slightly more, goes slower, takes up more room on the street, and has wider turns? Fail much? That's what I'm talking about. They have a bigger vehicle because they need to move more people, so they decide to ***** their main objective and change the design to so it's built for a lower density of people? Why didn't they just make a longer, low-floor version of the current streetcars with the current (well-designed) seating arrangements? A vehicle that's 24% longer than a streetcar that can seat 62 people comfortably shouldn't only fit another 9 people, nor should it have average (comfortable) standing arrangements for 32 less people than the shorter one. The ability to carry only 37 more people in cramped, horrible discomfort due to the terrible interior layout chosen isn't anything to be proud of. _______________ Could HAVE , not could OF.

It's October 25th, 1989. Jive Bunny and the Mastermixers are at number one with \"That's What I Like,\" which is unseated after two weeks by Lisa Stansfield's \"All Around the World,\" which rides out the story. Phil Collins, Belinda Carlisle, Kylie Minogue, and New Kids on the Block also chart. This being rather dismal, let's note that Kate Bush's The Sensual World comes out during this story, which is an altogether more fitting analogy. In real news, Nicaragua ends its ceasefire with the US-backed contras, and Douglas Wilder and David Dinkins become the first African-American governor in the US and mayor of New York City, respectively. The General Assembly of the Church of England votes to allow the ordination of women. Increasingly desperate measures are taken to deal with an ambulance strike in Britain. And oh yeah, the Berlin Wall falls. While on television we get The Curse of Fenric, which is one of the best things ever. It is also, of course, oddly incoherent. The biggest howler by its own logic is pointed out by Tat Wood. Much of the plot hinges on the fact that everyone at the base is a descendent of the viking settlers. These would be, of course, the viking settlers who were all killed by vampires, according to the inscriptions. Oops. And yet I've watched Curse of Fenric more than any other Doctor Who story, and I never noticed this problem. I'll bet that an overwhelming majority of you haven't either. And this is an important observation that provides a lot of insight into how we have to understand Curse of Fenric. Rather more of you, I suspect, have noticed things like the fact that the chess puzzle and its solution are completely non-sensical, that a mate-in-one puzzle that stumps an ancient god for ages is ridiculous, that nordic runes are a strange way to make a logic diagram, that no understanding whatsoever of how to crack a German code would also be able to translate a language, and that the inscription does not, in fact, read \"let the chains of Fenric shatter\" but instead reads \"Leek, Abracadabra, Presto Chango, Leek.\" (OK, possibly only my good friend Anna noticed that last one. Incidentally, there's a big line of commentary I'm just dropping here about the Norse mythological roots of this story. That is because towards the end of August Anna is providing us with a guest post on the relationship between McCoy's Doctor and Odin.) It may seem strange to harp on the plot holes of this story, given that I don't usually do that. After all, it's not like the understanding of Norse runes in this story is actually any weirder than the series' understanding of physics in many other stories. But there is something subtly different about the distortions here. For one thing, this starts to tack towards playing fast and loose with history, something Doctor Who has, of course, never ever done in any way shape or form. But more broadly, Curse of Fenric relies on distorted versions of things that are understood, as opposed to impossible (or at the very least colossally improbable) versions of things that are not yet understood. There is, in other words, something fundamentally different about creating a wonky version of chess than creating a wonky version of faster than light travel. All of which is a long way of saying that Curse of Fenric continues Ghost Light's approach of allowing the story's logic to be associative rather than strictly causal. But whereas Ghost Light invites a compulsive, scurrying picking through of its themes and links, Curse of Fenric lurches forward with mad, claustrophobic adrenaline. Tat Wood chalks it up to the wartime setting, and it's true that this helps, but there's so much more to it than that. It's also the return to a straightforward horror film setup, and the willingness to just linger in extended sequences of unbridled frights. And, perhaps most importantly, it's the way in which the story starts in Act III. This is something the McCoy era has played with before. Remembrance was effectively an Act III to an unscreened Act I and a half-remembered dream of An Unearthly Child as Act II. Greatest Show in the Galaxy played at starting at the end, but didn't quite make the concept hold together. Battlefield was Act III to a story whose first acts were yet to come. But here in Curse of Fenric we finally get the unadulterated version. Fenric is the final part of a story that has skipped the beginning and instead gone straight for the climax. And so everything spirals up to massive, apocalyptic proportions at a dizzying rate. The mistake that it's easy to make is to think that because the story is driven forward at such an unrelenting pace that it's the least bit facile in what's going on behind the scenes. This isn't something like 24 that holds together an absurd penny dreadful with the unceasing suspense of a ticking clock. Or, if we want to"}

Believers in military Keynesianism and domestic Keynesianism continue to desperately promote their failed policies, as the economy languishes in a deep slumber.\" He's dead right. Around the world, economic ignorance abounds. And perhaps nowhere is this more obvious today than in the senseless prattling over the US 'Fiscal Cliff'. Here's the deal: You may remember the Debt Ceiling debacle of 2011. At the time, the US government was about to breach its debt ceiling, and there was an embarrassing standoff between Congress and President Obama. As part of their eventual compromise, the debt ceiling increased by $400 billion in August 2011... then again by another $500 billion five weeks later... and finally by another $1.2 TRILLION twenty weeks after that. In return, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law stipulates that, unless another compromise is reached, a series of tax increases and budget cuts will automatically take place on January 1, 2013, including the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the temporary 2% payroll tax holiday, plus new taxes related to Obamacare. They call this the 'Fiscal Cliff' because everyone is terrified that all the budget cuts and new taxes will bring the US economy to its knees once again. I've spent days analyzing the bill... and frankly, it's a joke. You can read the 200+ pages yourself if you like, but here are the important points --  As we've discussed before, US government spending falls into three categories. Discretionary spending is what we normally think of as 'government.' It funds everything from the military to Homeland Security to the national parks. Mandatory spending covers all the major entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. Then there's interest on the debt, which is so large they had to make it a special category. The latter two categories are spent automatically, just like your mortgage payment that gets sucked out of the bank account before you have a chance to spend it. The only thing Congress has a say over is Discretionary Spending. Hence the name. But here's the problem -- the US fiscal situation is so untenable that the government fails to collect enough tax revenue to cover mandatory spending and debt interest. In Fiscal Year 2011, for example, the US government spent $176 billion MORE on debt interest and mandatory spending than they generated in tax revenue. In Fiscal Year 2012, which just ended 6 weeks ago, that shortfall increased to $251 billion. This means that they could cut the ENTIRE discretionary budget and still be in the hole by $251 billion. This is why the Fiscal Cliff is irrelevant. The automatic cuts that are going to take place don't even begin to address the actual problem; they're cutting $110 billion from the discretionary budget... yet only $16.9 billion from the mandatory budget. Given that the entire problem is with mandatory spending, slashing the discretionary budget is pointless. It's as if the US economy is a speeding train heading towards a ravine at 200 mph, and the conductors are arguing about whether they should slow down to 150 or 175. Oh, and there's just one more problem. The government thinks that they will collect a few hundred billion dollars more in tax revenue when all of these new taxes kick in. Again, wishful thinking. In the six+ decades since the end of World War II, tax rates in the US have been all over the board. Yet during this time, the US government has only managed to collect roughly 17.7% of GDP in tax revenue. Conclusion? Increasing taxes won't increase their total tax revenue. Politicians have tried this for decades. It doesn't work. The only way to increase tax revenue is for the economy to grow... and higher tax rates do not pave this path to prosperity. Ron Paul was spot on. Economic ignorance abounds. And all the Talking Heads in the mainstream media blathering away about the Fiscal Cliff are only reinforcing his premise. Bottom line -- the Fiscal Cliff doesn't matter. The US passed the point of no return a long time ago."}

Several coaches have called for substitutions to be cut from 10 to eight or less - claiming it would have a multitude of benefits for the game, including enhancing player safety. But with the rules committee to meet in early December, ARLC director of football operations Nathan McGuirk said a reduction in interchanges was not in the pipeline. \"It won't be for next year,\" McGuirk told AAP. \"It's something we have to give clubs at least 12 months advanced notice of, mainly due to the impact it would have on recruitment. \"It's something that we wouldn't rush into making a decision on. We would look at the implications of making such a serious change to the way the game would be played.\" Given the research the ARLC would need to undertake, no change would be likely before December 2013, which means the earliest it could come into effect would be the 2015 season. Coaches argue that less substitutions would have key benefits including creating greater fatigue and, in turn, minimising the impact of collisions - one of the key pillars on which this week's decision to ban the shoulder charge was based. Fewer interchanges would also increase the impact and value of smaller players in the game at a time when contests increasingly involve hulking forwards powering up the middle and slowing down the ruck. St George Illawarra coach Steve Price added his voice to calls from his peers for less substitutions. \"People talk about player safety and players are four kilos heavier over the last 10 years, players are taller - I believe in reducing the interchange,\" Price said. \"It gives an opportunity for younger players to come into the game, it's going to evolve more space into the game, it's going to reduce the injury rate, it's going to eliminate numbers in the tackle. Asked what the magic number should be, Price said: \"If you're going to reduce the interchange, you start it at eight and go from there.\" Parramatta coach Ricky Stuart went even further earlier this year. \"The quicker we cut it down to six (interchanges), the sooner you'll see a better game of football in regards to the little man, who everybody pays their money to come and watch play.\""}

The proposal -- if one is ever hammered out -- would also have to go before voters. To get there by November, officials would have to move fast. The Knox County Election Commission would need the ballot language by the end of August, and the commission would have to twice sign off on the proposal and hold at least one public forum. Officials says it's doable, but they're not quite sure if they're ready to pull the trigger this year. Members suggested Monday in a discussion that a smaller board is more easily controlled by outside political forces, and that the large districts are too big for one person to oversee and result in costly campaign expenses. \"We've been cut in half and don't have as much time to represent (the county),\" said Commissioner Dave Wright, who spearheaded the discussion. Wright added that although the position is a part-time job it's \"more than just a Monday afternoon once a month,\" referring to the commission's voting session. He said commissioners are the point people in their respective districts, and residents often call them for matters unrelated to county government. Residents, he said, expect them to either have answers or respond. Wright, who represents East Knox County, one of the largest geographical districts, added that \"more hands on deck\" would give officials the chance to better serve the community. He also said it would give members more time to focus on the commission committees that often vet larger issues before they're brought to the overall board. \"I think we'll all be better informed if we have more people doing specific tasks,\" he said. Commissioner Mike Brown agreed, adding that a commission composed of more members with smaller districts will give others a chance to run. \"There are hundreds of people in Knox County qualified to sit in those seats, but they can't afford to run,\" he said, noting that it could cost more than $100,000 for an unknown to run for a countywide commission seat. \"It shouldn't be that if you have the money then you get the job. But, that's what it will turn into. Either that, or in order to run, you'll have to sell your soul to the rich to get them to support you.\" Commissioners' opinions vary widely about how they would change the board, which voters in November 2008 reduced from 19 to 11. Under the current makeup, two represent the entire county and nine represent a commission district. Some members want to create more districts and increase membership to 13-15. Others are inclined to keep the panel the same size but do away with the two at-large seats, questioning the effectiveness of a commissioner from one part of the county working with a resident who lives in another part. Others aren't so sure anything should change. \"I think we need to hold off and consider all the options and not try to rush this to the ballot,\" commission Vice Chairman Brad Anders said. \"It's been four years (since the switch) and the new terms have not even completed themselves yet. And if you rush it, then we're not going to have all the questions answered.\" He also noted that the commission in November redrew county districts so that they aligned with the school system representatives, a move that took months to complete. Commissioners in April broached the proposal to increase board membership as the Knox County Charter Review Committee got into full swing. The 27-member committee, which includes most of the commission, is charged with analyzing the county's governing documents and making changes that will be placed on the August and November ballots. It could take up the issue of reducing the commission's size, but officials say the committee already has a full plate. In the meantime, commission Chairman Mike Hammond, an at-large officeholder, said he's fine with bringing the issue back to the ballot, but not as early as November. He said he'd want to hold public hearings and let officials put together several proposals for the community to vet. \"I don't think we should try to hurry and do it right now,\" he said. \"I don't think that's in anyone's best interest.\" Calling out, the rightwingers, republican 'base', the election year 'christains', local politicians, and especially the county commission, for fabricating an issue, creating a drama, when there are actual, reality based, problems, real issues, to deal with..

So I had a look round on everybody's favourite Auction site and bought an old Nokia 5110 as being a previous owner I knew you could detach the Aerial & there was a rubber bung on the back of the phone which could be replaced with a switch. The battery it uses is a 3.7v 900mah NiCad. So I purchased said mobile phone listed as faulty which didn't bother me as I only really needed the body and the phone only cost 5 plus del, I then ordered a 1100mah battery which was 7 and a 510 adaptor. So the phone arrived and I stripped it all down just to get an idea as to how much space there was to play, not a lot I may add. Pulled the Aerial out and tried to shove the 510 connector in but it was just a little to big, so set about chopping the housing and went a little bit crazy with the Dremel and finally managed to create a hole big enough to accommodate the 510 connector. As I'm an electronics engineer there's plenty of bits & pieces lying about work just waiting to be donated to a good cause, so I pulled a switch & the plastic button out of a willing satellite receiver and brought them home. Sat around for a few hours soldering and epoxying the bits into place and I'm pleased to say it all works. It's fairly simple as I've only taken a + and - feed from the battery, run the + feed through the switch and as a bonus I've got a battery indicator and if I really find the need to I can play Snake or whatever other games are in the phone. The only drawback is you can't send/receive calls, texts on it. I like it because it's a mind fuck as people see you walking down the street whilst your vaping on a Mobile Phone. Anyway enjoy and apologies about the shitty paintwork as it's still work in progress and couldn't find a colour match for the original body."}

Freelance writer contributing to The Next Web / Neowin. I don't know why the mainstream media hasn't covered this more, but Windows 8 isn't just Microsoft's big new Operating System that is going to somehow change the way we think about computing, it's also now an advertising platform designed to sell you, the user . There hasn't been that much coverage on this, but Microsoft is heavily pushing their new advertising platform which just happens to be the OS that you paid for. This isn't really widely used yet, but the effects are already obvious in many of the bundled Metro UI applications already displaying ads. Now, I don't know about you, but I don't feel great having paid to buy an Xbox 360 and then paying monthly to play games online and still having advertising shoved in my face. It doesn't seem right, nor is it fair, but it still happens. The future is ads Thus is the tale of Windows 8 now too. You pay for the OS license (even in the Enterprise) and the ads still exist. You subscribe to Microsoft's new Xbox Music service and the ads still stay. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning of this story too. Right now, Microsoft's official applications have some basic advertising in them, but I'm worried about what comes next. Ads while I send email? When I'm searching my files? There needs to be a way to turn this off. I suspect this move could be a sort of test for the company, with them thinking that perhaps at a later date Windows could become a freemium model, or discounted by advertising. They would -- in theory -- be able to make the OS completely free, thus dominating the desktop space in a perpetual manner. Either way, I don't like the future. Advertising is already shoved in our faces in things that we've paid the full price for, with no way to remove them and across every medium we interact with daily. We can't get away from it, and now, it's fundamentally on every device you use, every day."}

Most people play for the competitiveness of the game and these kind of situations are never competitive. Life is more important than the game, so I can't hate on someone who has to go AFK.

Don't know if rebalancing is needed for other maps) This way, if the players just want to quit so that they can go to the next game, there will be some incentive to actually sticking around and trying to win. Besides, if you have a valid reason for going AFK (and valid reasons do exist cause life IS more important than a game), than a 20min no game won't affect those who genuinely needed to leave, but will penalize the trolls and quitters."}

It was a series of vulgar text messages from Peter Slipper? -- ?including one comparing  female genitalia to shell-less mussels? -- ?that eventually forced him out of the speaker's chair. Yet Crikey suspects many media consumers, especially those who rely on the ABC for news, would be utterly confused about exactly why the speaker has resigned. The mussels remark, first reported by The Australian Financial Review last Thursday, dominated parliament yesterday and is repeated in print today by The Age , The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian . The TV networks, however, have been far less forthcoming. In Channel Nine's lead story on the 6pm news last night, press gallery veteran Laurie Oakes said the remarks were \"too disgusting for broadcast\". ABC political correspondent Mark Simkin, whose 7pm report was accompanied by a blurred graphic of a text message, also gave the remarks a wide berth. As a rule, ABC online has referred only to Slipper's \"offensive language to describe female genitalia\". Latelin e, which airs at at 10.30pm, also made no mention of the \"m word\" last night? -- ?even though host Emma Alberici conducted a 15-minute interview with Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek about the messages. We'd be interested to know what Crikey readers think. Do ABC viewers have a right to know what Slipper said in his texts and why he was forced from his post? Or are the remarks simply too unpalatable to broadcast? Have you heard the remarks repeated on radio or TV? We'll follow up the issue tomorrow. ? -- Matthew Knott ' Catch-up' television takes off. Watching TV online has become mainstream, with 5.2 million Australians looking at professionally-produced video online in the last six months, according to a new report by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The report, Online video content services in Australia , concludes \"catch-up\" TV (such as the ABC's iView) is the dominant use of online video. Recent episodes of television shows are the most popular content. The report also finds a high level of willingness to pay for online video. Half of those intending to access an online video service in the next six months? -- ?2.8 million Australians? -- ?indicated they were prepared to pay for such access.? -- Glenn Dyer Video of the day.

But, as tasteless as \"shell-less mussels\" is, it's hardly going to make your hair go white. If that's as bad as it gets, then I think there'd be a fair swag of the parliament and the press gallery who'd need to find a new job. Given there's masses of media coverage of this issue, it would seem imperative that us, the mug punters, get a chance to read the primary sources, not have our betters in the media pant breathlessly about how terrible it is, but not let us get a chance to evaluate ourselves.

The expenditure will also include modernising the facilities at existing Telstra data centres in Sydney and Melbourne, expanding the telco's enterprise applications, launching an online partner portal, and enhancing T-Suite software-as-a-service (SaaS) capabilities. Telstra's chief operations officer, Brendon Riley, said the company's objective is to have the biggest network integration of Cloud in Australia. \"We are now completing expansion of our Sydney datacentre facilities to accommodate our next generation data centre,\" he said. \"We also want to build a new state of the art data centre in Melbourne to support our expansion. \"It will be of modular construction for maximum Green capabilities and I anticipate it will be commissioned in early 2013.\" According to Riley, the new Melbourne facility will increase its data centre capability by more than 40 per cent and provide Cloud requirements for \"many years to come\". \"Cloud is not all about data centres, but they are important,\" he said. \"On top of that we are going to provision a highly scalable network. \"We all want efficient and scalable infrastructure to adapt to the demands we have.\" To achieve the Cloud services, the telco has partnered with Cisco, VMware and Microsoft, while integration partner Accenture will build the next phase of its integrated Cloud platform. Telstra chief executive David Thodey said that while Cloud services were nothing new for the vendor -- as the telco began offering T-Suite software-as-a-service (SaaS) in 2008 -- the investments were made due to increasing customer demand. \"We are also experiencing strong sales in our Cloud voice and video services, which are exceeding 80 per cent year and we now manage more than 100,000 IP telephony services delivered from the Cloud,\" Thodey said. \"With this Cloud computing platform we can provide Cloud services that are integrated into our networks, which means they are secure, monitored and can be accessed in more locations across the country.\" He also said that the company wanted to offer customer Cloud so they could focus on other areas of their business. \"This is part of a bigger transition within Telstra from being not just an access provider, but a company capable of offering different services to SMEs, enterprise and corporations,\" Thodey said."}
